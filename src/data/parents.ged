  2 CONT This site claims that John b. 1675 died in 1721, which would rule him out (based on multiple voices about the Greene children coming to Killingly with Dorothy Lynde and her husband John Barrett, children born in Killingly to John 
  2 CONC and Dorothy Barrett, etc.) as the husband of Dorothy Lynde.

  2 CONT From http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/BARRETT/2007-11/1194877092

  2 CONT I believe that John Barrett (1675-1741) married twice; first to Sarah Eustace on 28 September 1699 and second to Rebecca Wells on 24 December 1719. I do not believe that this John Barrett (1675-1741) was married to 
  2 CONT Dorothy Lynde; if he had been, he would have been 58 years old when Abigail was born (1733), which would be unusual at that time period.

  2 CONT
  2 CONT HOME:
  2 CONT In 1677, Tristram Coffin gave his son, John, an interest in Nantucket. While at Nantucket, John lived on his father’s lot. Housing lots of the original settlers were approximately 1000 feet on a side (roughly 25 acres), but often 
  2 CONC quite irregular shaped properties. Tristram’s lot was bordered on the north side by Capum Harbor, now a landlocked pond. After Tristram died, John moved to Martha’s Vinyard, where he lived the rest of his life.{D1}

  2 CONT His move from Nantucket to Edgartown, on Martha’s Vinyard, occurred ca. 1682-83.

  2 CONT Tristram’s son, John, our second generation ancestor was born 30 October 1647 in Haverhill, Massachusetts. He was the seventh of nine children born to Tristram and Dionis. John Coffin was the progenitor of most of the Martha’s Vin
  2 CONC eyard Coffins. He was about 13 years old when his family moved from the mainland to the town of Sherborn on Nantucket. In 1668, a young man of 21 years, he married at Nantucket, Deborah Austin, daughter of Joseph and Sarah (Starbu
  2 CONC ck) Austin of Nantucket. On Nantucket John was a blacksmith and held a few minor offices. In Tristram’s will, he gave John “… his new dwelling house, with all other houses adjoining unto it etc” to be John’s property to be his imm
  2 CONC ediately upon the decease of Tristram and wife, Dionis. We learn, however, that John removed to Edgartown, Martha’s Vineyard, a year after his father died and two years before his mother died. That was in 1682 when John was 36 yea
  2 CONC rs old. Martha’s Vineyard was then a part of New York.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT It is believed that Thomas Mayhew asked John to come to Martha’s Vineyard as there was a need for a blacksmith. Mayhew reportedly sold John 8 acres for $1.00 fronting on Edgartown Harbor and running back in a wide swath to Peases’
  2 CONC  Point Way. This lot was purchased from Thomas Paine’s estate. Paine, Governor Thomas Mayhew’s stepson and son-in-law, was lost at sea in 1657, along with Thomas Mayhew, Jr., on a voyage to England.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT John built his first home on that property in 1682, a one story structure 24′ X 32′ with a shed roof and faced the harbor. The original portion of the house is buried by much enlargement and modification. It was on this property t
  2 CONC hat he had his blacksmith shop. The blacksmithing trade must have been very profitable for John Coffin became the owner of much real estate on Martha’s Vineyard. In the 1700′s, the house was owned by various craftsmen, tailors and
  2 CONC  coopers among them. Today the address is 55 South Water Street. Looking East from this property today, one sees the Yacht Club, Town Dock, Chappy Ferry, and Chappaquiddick Island.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT 1.  John and Deborah’s second house on Martha’s Vineyard was built in 1703. Today the address for this house is 22 North Water Street, Edgartown. The house was occupied by John’s descendants for many generations until it was taken
  2 CONC  over by the North Water Street Corporation in 1946 to preserve it. It, like the Desire Coffin house, is now maintained by the Preservation Society and is occupied by antique and decorator’s shops.

  2 CONT Among the many who have lived in the house was the famed Dr. Daniel Fisher. He married Grace C. Coffin, John’s great-great-granddaughter in 1829 soon after coming to the Island. Her dowry, it is said, was her weight in silver. We 
  2 CONC don’t know how much she weighed, but no doubt enough to help Dr. Fisher begin his many business enterprises. Dr Fisher built his own sidewalk from the front door to the corner of Main Street so he wouldn’t get muddy shoes. The hou
  2 CONC se sat much closer to the street, then a mere cart path, and when it was widened, the house was moved back and it appears that the rear addition was turned 90 degrees and reattached. There are eight other Coffin homes on the Walki
  2 CONC ng Tour of Martha’s  Vineyard which were built and owned by John’s descendants. [The greatly renovated John Coffin & decsendants house at 22 North Water Street, Edgartown, Martha's Vinyard. The original house is encased within the

  2 CONT 2.  John and Deborah had eleven children of whom nine grew to be adults. Four sons and three daughters were mentioned in his will dated 1 Sept 1711. In his will probated 17 April 1712, he leaves sheep on Nantucket, now in possessi
  2 CONC on of son Peter, to wife Deborah. (It is wondered if son Peter lived in the house deeded to John by his father?) He also mentions sons, Samuel, Enoch and Tristram and daughters Hannah Gardner, Deborah Macy and Lydia Thaxter. Daugh
  2 CONC ters Love and Elizabeth may have died young or as spinsters prior to 1711. John Jr. and Benjamin probably died young.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT After John died 5 September 1711 at Edgartown, Martha’s Vineyard, Deborah returned to Nantucket where she died 4 February 1718. The will of Deborah Coffin (wife of John ) dated 13 March 1717/18 probated 13 May 1718 names son Trist

  2 CONT
  2 CONT John and Deborah were the parents of our third generation ancestor, Samuel, “King Sam”. In 1706, Samuel Coffin, and his wife Miriam (Gardner) joined the Society of Friends. Two years later his parents (John and Deborah) joined. Hi

 1 NOTE {geni:occupation} 8th great aunt. Quaker leader on Nantucket
 1 NOTE {geni:about_me} "Reverend" Mary Coffin was born February 20, 1644/45 in Haverhill, Massachusetts just two years after her parents' arrival from Devonshire, England.  She moved to Nantucket Island with her father, Tristram Coffin, 
  2 CONC who led the colonization of the island in 1660-1661.  In 1662 she married Nathaniel Starbuck, a prosperous farmer, local official, and partner with her father in purchasing the area from the Indians. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT "Great Mary," or the "Great Woman," as she is frequently referred to, was an exceptional woman. Born off-island in 1645, she and her husband Nathaniel were the first English couple married on Nantucket and parents of the first whi
  2 CONC te child (a daughter, Mary) born on Nantucket Island, in 1663.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Mary (the mother) was the island's first storekeeper and Nathaniel invested in whaling. In later life she had a deep commitment to Quaker ideals and was instrumental in the growth and development of Nantucket's Religious Society o
  2 CONC f Friends.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Mother of ten children, of whom five daughters and three sons lived to maturity, Mary and her eldest son Nathaniel helped make Quakerism the leading religion on the island sometime after her own conversion from Puritanism by the Q
  2 CONC uakers of Providence, RI in 1701 at the age of 56. She was a minister, as were her children and grandchildren.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT "The islanders esteemed [Mary Starbuck] as a judge among them, for little was done without her, as I understood," wrote Englishman John Richardson, describing his 1701 visit. He bestowed on her the epithet "the great woman," and i
  2 CONC n the same journal entry deprecated her husband as "not a man of mean parts but she so far exceeded him in soundness of judgment, clearness of understanding, and an elegant way of expressing herself ... that it tended to lessen th
  2 CONC e qualifications of her husband." 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Mary was a "most extraordinary woman, participating in the practical duties and responsibilities of public gatherings and town meetings, on which occasions her words were always listened to with marked respect." For several years,
  2 CONC  Meetings or worships as well as Nantucket's political affairs were held in the "great fore-room" of her home which became known as "Parliament House," situated on what is now known as Island View Farm between the Macy's and the n
  2 CONC orth head of Hummock ponds.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Despite Mary's involvement in the weighty matters of religion, she did not neglect domestic issues, as evidenced by a letter which Lydia Hinchman quotes in Early Settlers of Nantucket. In the aftermath of a fire experienced by her
  2 CONC  granddaughter, Eliza Gorham, Mary wrote to her:

  2 CONT
  2 CONT - Savage, see citations
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Discussion:
  2 CONT
  2 CONT There has been disagreement on whether Sarah, Esther, and
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Susannah/Shuah were all STARBUCKS....and sisters. Also, some question on the identity of all of their (multiple) husbands.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Their dates, and even their names, are listed in several ways.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT I'm a descendant of Sarah STARBUCK m2 Joseph AUSTIN; and also, I thought, of the same Sarah STARBUCK m3 Humphrey VARNEY. However, others say that depending on the marriage date, my ancestress with Humphrey VARNEY would be Esther S
  2 CONC TARBUCK, Sarah's sister (if indeed they were sisters).
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Very confusing! Here it is, charted out:
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT 1. Sarah STARBUCK (c1630-1713), dau. of Edward STARBUCK and Catherine REYNOLDS, is said to have m (1) William Storer or Storey; (2) Joseph AUSTIN (c1616-1663);
  2 CONT
  2 CONT (3) Humphrey VARNEY (d.1714) [as his 2nd wife]
  2 CONT
  2 CONT I believe this is agreed upon, except for some duality in the
  2 CONT
  2 CONT marriage date of Sarah to Humphrey VARNEY -- which clouds the situation as to who is the mother of Humphrey's son Ebenezer (see #3 below).
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT 2. Humphrey VARNEY's first wife Esther is said by some to be the sister of his 2nd wife Sarah STARBUCK. However, C.A. Torrey [NEW ENG.MARR...1700, p765] qualifies her surname with brackets:
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Humphrey VARNEY (-1714)

  2 CONT
  2 CONT 3. What is the correct marriage date for Humphrey VARNEY to Sarah STARBUCK? January or March? 1664 or 1665? All combinations of these are listed by various sources. It determines the mother of Humphrey son Ebenezer VARNEY (who m. 
  2 CONC Mary OTIS), if Ebenezer was born in 1664. However . . . To further muddy the waters, there are two birth years for
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Ebenezer VARNEY: 1664, and also 1670. Is there any corroboration on Ebenezer's birth year?
  2 CONT
  2 CONT I've received an e-mail saying that Ebenezer was age 19 when

  2 CONT

  2 CONT
  2 CONT Date: Tue, 4 Apr 2000 15:12:19 -0700 (PDT)
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT There has been disagreement on whether Sarah, Esther, and
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Susannah/Shuah were all STARBUCKS....and sisters. Also, some
  2 CONT
  2 CONT question on the identity of all of their (multiple) husbands.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Their dates, and even their names, are listed in several ways.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT I'm a descendant of Sarah STARBUCK m2 Joseph AUSTIN; and also, I
  2 CONT
  2 CONT thought, of the same Sarah STARBUCK m3 Humphrey VARNEY. However,
  2 CONT
  2 CONT others say that depending on the marriage date, my ancestress
  2 CONT
  2 CONT with Humphrey VARNEY would be Esther STARBUCK, Sarah's sister
  2 CONT
  2 CONT (if indeed they were sisters).
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Very confusing! Here it is, charted out:
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT 1. Sarah STARBUCK (c1630-1713), dau. of Edward STARBUCK and
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Catherine REYNOLDS, is said to have
  2 CONT
  2 CONT m (1) William Storer or Storey;
  2 CONT
  2 CONT (2) Joseph AUSTIN (c1616-1663);
  2 CONT
  2 CONT (3) Humphrey VARNEY (d.1714) [as his 2nd wife]
  2 CONT
  2 CONT I believe this is agreed upon, except for some duality in the
  2 CONT
  2 CONT marriage date of Sarah to Humphrey VARNEY -- which clouds the
  2 CONT
  2 CONT situation as to who is the mother of Humphrey's son Ebenezer
  2 CONT
  2 CONT (see #3 below).
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT 2. Humphrey VARNEY's first wife Esther is said by some to be the
  2 CONT
  2 CONT sister of his 2nd wife Sarah STARBUCK. However, C.A. Torrey
  2 CONT
  2 CONT [NEW ENG.MARR...1700, p765] qualifies her surname with brackets:
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Humphrey VARNEY (-1714)
  2 CONT
  2 CONT m (1) Esther[STARBUCK]/AUSTIN; Glouchester/Dover NH
  2 CONT
  2 CONT (2) Sarah (STARBUCK)/(STORER?) AUSTIN, wid Joseph;
  2 CONT
  2 CONT 2 Mar 1664; Dover NH
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Is there a record of birth for Esther STARBUCK? Was she really
  2 CONT
  2 CONT a Starbuck?
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Why is Esther listed above with a surname of Austin?
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT 3. What is the correct marriage date for Humphrey VARNEY to Sarah
  2 CONT
  2 CONT STARBUCK? January or March? 1664 or 1665? All combinations of

  2 CONT
  2 CONT I've received an e-mail saying that Ebenezer was age 19 when

  2 CONT Sarah (SHATTUCK) Gardener was feisty!
  2 CONT Per "History of Nantucket" by Alexander Starbuck: 
  2 CONT She (Sarah Starbuck) had made herself obnoxious to the Massachusetts government by sympathizing with the Quakers, had been brought before the Salem Court for absenting herself "from the publik ordinances on the Lord's day, for neg
  2 CONC lecting to attend services at the First Church in Salem and for attending assemblies of the Friends, and had been excommunicated from the First Church in Salem for so doing. The widow Sarah was a woman of decided opinions and not 
  2 CONC inclined to mask them. Sarah, daughter of Richard and Sarah, married Eleazer Folger, son of Peter and when Peter was imprisoned during the "Insurrection," the Gardner family showed indignation and were arrested. They failed to app
  2 CONC ear at the Court held April 22, 1677 to which they were summoned but did appear at the Court next following with this result: 'Sarah, wife of Mr. Richard Gardner, being legally convicted of speaking very opprobriously and uttering
  2 CONC  many slanderous words concerning the imprisonment of Peter Folger who was imprisoned by order of the court, upon her good demeaning herself, and civilly being to the good satisfaction and likeness of the court, the Court think fi
  2 CONC t to remit all other fines provided by law in such case, but she shall be reproved and admonished to have care for the future of evil words tending to defaming His Majesty's Court.'"

  2 CONT '''The First in The Race That Settled America'''
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In 1642 Tristram emigrated to America with his wife Dionis and five small children as well as his widowed mother and two unmarried sisters.  What was the cause of this emigration is not known.  Tristram was of the landed gentry an
  2 CONC d had inherited from his father.  But there was political trouble between the king and Parliament and the New World was calling with an ever stronger voice. It is thought that they sailed in one of four ships owned by Robert Cleme
  2 CONC nt (the Hector, Griffin, Job Clement and Margaret Clement).  The Coffyn family settled in Salisbury, Massachusetts for a while and then moved to Haverhill which had been founded in 1640.  In 1659 Tristram investigated Martha's Vin
  2 CONC eyard and Nantucket.  With some others they dealt with the Indians and purchased the island of Nantucket.  Tristram always got along well with the Indians.  By this time some of his children were married and did not move to Nantuc
  2 CONC ket, but some of them moved with Tristram and Dionis.  Tristram was appointed the first chief magistrate of Nantucket in 1671.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT --------------------
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram married before coming to America and lived, successively at Haverhill, Newbury, Salisbury and finally on Nantucket Island, where he died. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT On the fifteenth of November, 1642, Passaquo and Saggahew, with the consent of Passaconaway who was leader of the Merrimacs, sold for L3 10s. "to the inhabitants of Pentucket," now Haverhill, a track of land fourteen miles long an
  2 CONC d six miles wide, "with ye isleand and the river that ye isleand stands in" etc. Among the witnesses to this deed was Tristram Coffyn, who had this year, arrived in New England and had moved from Salisbury to Haverhill. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram is said to have been the first man to use a plow in Haverhill. He was a royalist, and was one of the few, if not the only early settler to come to New England as a consequence of the success of Oliver Cromwell. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In about 1644, Tristram and his family moved to Newbury, where he became a prominent inn keeper and ferryman. In Newbury in 1644 Tristram was granted permission to "keep an ''ordinary'' (saloon), sell wine and keep a ferry on the 
  2 CONC Newbury side of the Merrimack between Newbury and Carr's island." George Carr ran the ferry from Carr's island to Salisbury. This arrangement was confirmed in the town records on December 26,1647: "Tristram Coffin (senior) is allo
  2 CONC wed tto keep a ferry at Newbury side."  In September 1653, Tristram Coffyn's wife Dionis Coffin was presented for selling beer, at his ordinary in Newbury, "for three pence a quart." (higher than the set price for beer). Having pr
  2 CONC oved "upon the testimony of Samuel Moores", that "she put six bushels of malt into a hogshead" she was discharged. Dionis was found to be "doctoring" the beer sold at the ordinary. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Contrary to current practice Dionis was making her beer stronger and charging a correspondingly higher price. The law at the time called for beer to be "good wholesome beer of four bushels of malt to the hogshead." Goodwife Coffin
  2 CONC  is said to have remarked: "I'll have better beer than my neighbors and be paid for it. A fig for the law." 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In 1654 or 1655, Tristram returned to Salisbury where he signed his name as "Tristram Coffyn, Commissioner of Salisbury." 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In 1659, Tristram and some of his sons were among a company of Salisbury men who purchased nineteen twentieths of the island of Nantucket from Thomas Mayhew. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In 1660 Tristram Sr. with wife, mother and some of his children moved to the island where this branch of the Coffin family continued. Tristram Jr. remained in Newbury with his wife and family. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT __________________
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram Coffyn was born in 1609 in Brixton Parish, town of Plymouth, Devonshire, England and baptized March 11, 1610. He was the eldest child of Peter and Johanna Coffin. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Coffyn's early years in England were during a very eventful time. Intellectual freedom was being claimed as a right for each individual. This period was during the reign of James I. Among the names of the day were William Shakespe
  2 CONC are, Francis Bacon and Oliver Cromwell. It was a period when the Puritans were making large gains in the Parliament. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram had one younger brother, John and four sisters, Johanna, Deborah, Eunice and Mary. When Tristram was 19 his father Peter, died. His will was dated December 21, 1627 and was proved by his widow Johanna on March 13, 1628. I
  2 CONC n the will it was declared that Tristram was to be provided for according to his degree and calling. Tristram was a farmer and therefore most likely took control of his fathers estate near Plymouth. Two years later Tristram courte
  2 CONC d and wed Dionis Stevens, daughter of Robert Stevens of Brixton. Dionis Stevens was born in 1609 although other accounts say 1613. Shortly after their marriage, their first child Peter was born in 1631 followed by their son Tristr
  2 CONC am Jr., born in 1632. During the early 1630's England entered into a storm of conflict with the death of James I and the succession of Charles I. In 1638 the Scots took up arms against the King. The Presbyterians took control of t
  2 CONC he Commons and this was followed by an all out civil war in 1642. During this period of time Tristram and Dionis had two more children Elizabeth (d.o.b. unknown) and James born August 12, 1639. Dionis was also pregnant with their 
  2 CONC fifth child. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In 1640 Coffyn was selected as a Warden of Brixton Parish. Shortly after in November 1640, he leased his farm that was located at Butlass. With the civil war closing in on his family and the wounding and eventual death eight days 
  2 CONC later of his brother John at Plymouth Fort, Tristram decided to take his family, including his mother and two unwed sisters to safety in Colonial America. Tristram's friend Robert Clement was leaving for America shortly, aboard a 
  2 CONC small fleet of ships, some of which were owned by Clement. Tristram quickly put his affairs in order and embarked on his journey with his family aboard Clement's ship named "Hector Clement" in the spring of 1642. This proved to be
  2 CONC  the last time Coffyn was to see his home in England. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT The crossing of the Atlantic took between 60 and 90 days before they arrived in Newburyport Massachusetts, during the summer of 1642. It was a mere twenty years since the pilgrims, aboard the Mayflower had landed at Plymouth. Shor
  2 CONC tly after their arrival, Tristram secured living quarters for his family and started exploring up the Merrimack River with Robert Clement in search of a good location for a more permanent home. He arrived in a soon to be called se
  2 CONC ttlement named Pentucket, now known as Haverhill Ma. The book "The History of Haverhill" by George Chase states that Clements son, Job Clements had already settled in the area a year earlier, if so, this could be the reason that C
  2 CONC offyn and Clements chose this area. They found the area to have fertile soil with the necessary resources to build a farm, however, it was recorded that the large population of wolves were a problem with the flocks of sheep and a 
  2 CONC guard had to be posted at all times. In 1641 there were only six homes built in this area Tristram's group of settlers negotiated with the Indians for the property rights and secured a twenty square mile area for the sum of three 
  2 CONC pounds ten shillings. A copy of this deed is still on record and bares witness to the signatures of Robert Clement and Tristram Coffyn, dated November 15, 1642. Not only is this the first record of the first Coffin immigrant in Am
  2 CONC erica, but it also indicates how Tristram spelled his surname, Coffyn, with a "y" instead of an "i". 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT It was also during this period that John, their youngest child fell ill and died. Dionis was also pregnant with their sixth child who was later named Deborah. She was born the first Coffin child in America, and the third child bor
  2 CONC n in the tiny settlement but was destined for the same fate as the other newborns and died three weeks later. These deaths give evidence to the harsh conditions that the first immigrants must have encountered upon their arrival in
  2 CONC  the new world. The living conditions were primitive and unforgiving and many families suffered greatly. It was noted that Coffyn was the first white settler to plough land in the area, having made his own plough from materials at
  2 CONC  hand. A few years after his arrival in Pentucket, his daughter Mary was born, becoming the first Coffin child to be born and survive to adulthood in America. The settlements survival was threatened in the early 1640's when Indian
  2 CONC  war parties decided to target the settlers homes. They wanted to halt the white invasion but they feared the firepower of the settlers muskets. The plan was to send a small group of Indians to each of the settlers homes at the sa
  2 CONC me time and gain entrance to the houses by pretending to want to trade with each of the settlers. Upon a predetermined signal, the Indians would then jump the homeowners, cut their throats and ransack the house looking for weapons
  2 CONC . What the Indians didn't know was that one of their members was a Colonial informant who revealed the plan to British intelligence and the British soldiers along with about forty settlers disarmed the Indians before they could se
  2 CONC t the plan in motion. The Indians backed away knowing that it would be foolish to try again in the near future. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT After only a few years of farming in Pentucket, Tristram embarked on a new direction. It would seem that not only was he a farmer, but he was also a businessman. When the opportunity arose to operate a ferry back in Newbury, he de
  2 CONC cided to move his family once again. The History of Newbury states that in 1644 Tristram Coffin Sr. is allowed to keep an Ordinary (Tavern) which consisted of selling wine and keeping a ferry and Inn on the Newbury side of the Mer
  2 CONC rimack River. George Carr kept a ferry on the Salisbury side across from Carr Island. These ferries crossed from Newbury on the south side, between Carr Island and Ram Island, over to the north side of Salisbury. The ferry was ope
  2 CONC rated by Tristram and most likely his older sons Peter and Tristram Jr. in the early years, and as the older boys developed other interests, James took over. In the 1650's Peter left Newbury to go to Dover, New Hampshire, where he
  2 CONC  became involved in the lumber business. Tristram's daughter Elizabeth wed Stephen Greenleaf in 1651 and resided in Newbury. Tristram Jr. married Judith Somerby in 1653 and became a weaver/tailer and Deacon of the First Parish of 
  2 CONC Newbury. Tristram Jr. is also the person who brought the Coffin name to the old Coffin mansion in 1654, which still stands in Newbury, housing over eight generations of Coffin descendants up to the 1850's. In 1997 I had the pleasu
  2 CONC re of visiting Newbury and the Coffin house which is now a historical site. The Coffin house is one of the earliest homes made of wood still standing in New England. It is believed that the father, Tristram Sr., lived here shortly
  2 CONC  before moving to his new home in Nantucket. In 1735 the first centennial of Newbury was celebrated by the town in the front yard of the Coffin house, under two gigantic elm trees. The Tavern and Inn in Newbury was operated mainly
  2 CONC  by Dionis, Tristram's wife, and was called "Coffins Ordinary". Not only did she serve the patrons but she was also responsible for making the beverages of the day, which eventually got the Coffyns into confrontation with the law.
  2 CONC  The laws of 1645 stated clearly that "every person licenced to keep an Ordinary (Tavern) shall always be provided with good wholesome beer of four bushels of malt to the hogshead, which he shall not sell above two pence the ale q
  2 CONC uart, on penalty of forty shillings the first offence and for the second offence shall lose his licence". Dionis' ale was made with six bushels, giving it a kick that kept them coming back for more. For her troubles she increased 
  2 CONC the price by one pence and in turn had to stand before the court to defend her actions. Eventually the charge was dismissed, but word spread quickly through Newbury as to where to go for a quality ale. According to the book "Ould 
  2 CONC Newbury" by John Currier, the Coffins owned forty acres across from Carr Island. In later years the road to the Inn was known as Coffin Lane and was on the west side of present day Jefferson St.. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Toward the mid 1650's the ferry crossings were replaced by a floating bridge leaving Tristram little choice but to sell his holding. He moved across the river to Salisbury where records show his name on some documents as Commissio
  2 CONC ner of Salisbury. It was during these years in the late 1650's that the first plans to relocate his family to a more desirable location were first laid out. Depending on which source one would believe, there are many arguments tha
  2 CONC t have been brought forward as to why Tristram decided to leave Massachusetts. All would have been valid arguments. It was true that the Puritan rule was harsh and prejudice against freedom of choice both religiously and political
  2 CONC ly. It was also true that the desire to move to an area where fences were not needed for the livestock (that an Island would provide) would be of some benefit. However, In the end, Tristram's desire to keep his family together aro
  2 CONC und him and in their own community outside of the smothering rules of the Puritans probably could have been the driving factor behind his decision to locate to a new home. In talking to his friends and neighbours he found he was n
  2 CONC ot alone in his thinking. Others were also anxious to leave, many for the same reasons as Coffyn. After a short time their ideas took shape and later after meeting it was decided to form a group of associates to pursue matters fur
  2 CONC ther. The idea of common pastures and buildings were appealing to many, especially the farmers who were advancing in age. The back breaking life of maintaining a farm could now be shared among the group with common mills and labou
  2 CONC r supplied by the Indians. How the Island of Nantucket, thirty miles off the south shore of Cape Cod ever came forth as a choice, is once again debatable. Some point out that the connection lies with Thomas Mayhew, the owner of Na
  2 CONC ntucket and Martha's Vineyard, was a cousin of one of the associates in Tristram's group, a man named Thomas Macy. Others think that Nantucket simply came up in a passing conversation and caught Coffyn's imagination. At one meetin
  2 CONC g the decision was made to send Tristram Coffyn, possibly his son James, Edward Starbuck and cabin boy Isaac Coleman on a fact finding mission to meet with Mayhew and view Nantucket to assess its suitability as a home. Early in 16
  2 CONC 59 the men set out for Edgartown in Martha's Vineyard, the home of Thomas Mayhew. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Thomas Mayhew came to New England before 1632 from Wiltshire England. By 1637 Mayhew was in the town of Watertown, Massachusetts, where he was operating a grist mill. His business enterprises were flourishing by the time the famil
  2 CONC y of John Folger arrived in Watertown. Mayhew had a son named Thomas Jr. who was very religious. Folger's son Peter was close to the same age as Thomas Jr. and the two became friends. They both shared an appetite for adventure, so
  2 CONC  when the opportunity came forth for the Mayhew's to purchase an Island named Nantucket, from the Earl of Stirling in 1641 for forty pounds, the adventure began. After seeing the Island it was concluded that Nantucket Island was t
  2 CONC oo far off shore and that Martha's Vineyard would be a more suitable island to inhabit, so shortly after Mayhew also bought Martha's Vineyard. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Thomas Mayhew Jr. moved quickly to establish his home on Martha's Vineyard bringing Peter Folger along with him. His mission was to teach the Indians that inhabited the Islands' Christianity. Folger was to be a school master and s
  2 CONC urveyor. The work was quite successful and the elder Mayhew came to join them in Edgartown. In 1657 Thomas Jr. found it necessary to go to England to stimulate more financial support, however, his ship was lost in a gale on the cr
  2 CONC ossing and he was never heard from again. Mayhew was devastated by the loss of his son, however he decided to continue with his son's mission. Folger on the other hand was looking for a change. His chance came in the form of a sha
  2 CONC llop sailing into the harbour at Edgartown with Tristram Coffyn on board. It's interesting to note that this simple twist of fate with Coffyn arriving in Edgartown while Folger was searching for a new adventure, brought about the 
  2 CONC circumstance to which American statesman, scientist and writer, Benjamin Franklin would later be born into. In later years, Folger's daughter, Abiah, of Nantucket, married Josiah Franklin, where in 1706 shortly after moving from N
  2 CONC antucket, gave birth to Benjamin Franklin. In turn this made Peter Folger, Ben Franklin's grandfather. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram's preliminary discussions with Mayhew were favourable. However, Mayhew insisted that if Coffyn's group wanted to purchase Nantucket, the Indians on the Island would have to be included in the negotiations. It was estimate
  2 CONC d that Nantucket had about 700 Narragansett Indians living in six villages, mostly on the east shore. Today, unfortunately, there is not a single Indian descendant living on the Island. The last Indian descendant died in the 1850'
  2 CONC s. Nantucket in Algonquin is interpreted as "far away Island". Coffyn realized that without an interpreter he would have problems communicating with the Indians. To address this problem he enlisted the services of Peter Folger who
  2 CONC  was also a skilled Surveyor. Shortly thereafter, the group left for the Island. The Indians greeted them favourably and although their interpretation of purchasing land proved to be different than the white interpretation, they a
  2 CONC greed on the idea. In later years the Indians were surprised to learn the meaning of trespassing, for in their culture no one ever owns property but instead they only had rights to live upon it, yet anyone could travel through it.
  2 CONC  After achieving their goal, Coffyn and the rest headed back to Edgartown for further negotiations with Mayhew. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Committed to carrying on with his lost son's work, Mayhew had no real interest in Nantucket and therefore agreed to very reasonable terms for the purchase of the Island. The sale price of 30 pounds along with two beaver hats, one 
  2 CONC for him and one for his wife, was a bargain especially if one considers that after owning the Island for close to twenty years Mayhew was selling it for ten pounds less than he bought it for. The beaver hats incidently were made b
  2 CONC y Tristram Jr. Today one can only speculate on the mood of the negotiations, but judging by the eventual results, Coffyn and Macy must have respected each other a great deal in order for things to have gone so smoothly. Mayhew did
  2 CONC  however retain a one twentieth share of the venture so he could have a voice in how the Island affairs were being handled. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Coffin returned home to Salisbury to organize the purchase of Nantucket. Once there, his eight partners ratified the agreement with Mayhew and ten new partners and ten tenant inhabitants were admitted into the company.

  2 CONT
  2 CONT In the fall of 1659 before any formal deed was drawn up with the Indian leaders Wanackmamack and Nickanoose, James Coffin, Thomas Macy and family, Edward Starbuck and Isaac Coleman left Salisbury for Nantucket to take up residence
  2 CONC . Macy was in trouble with the Puritan judges for harbouring Quakers during a short rain storm. Nantucket was out of the Judge's legal realm, so rather than stay and face the charges he decided that the sooner he could leave Salis
  2 CONC bury the better it would be. Edward Starbuck was Macy's partner in the company and also his best friend. He felt compelled to go with Macy and the rest to see them through what was going to be a tough first winter. James Coffin ag
  2 CONC e 19 went to watch over his father's interests and Isaac Coleman age 13 was probably just looking for adventure. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT The first winter on Nantucket proved to be one full of hardships. The crossing was reported to have been a rough one in which the tiny craft was almost lost. During the first winter the Indians were said to have been most helpful 
  2 CONC in seeing to the needs of the first white settlers on the Island. In the spring of 1660 Edward Starbuck returned to Salisbury to update the rest on the progress of Nantucket. The reports were favourable and others made preparation
  2 CONC s to relocate quickly. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT The freedom enjoyed in Nantucket, by being independent from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was the lure that attracted many from Salisbury. But along with their freedom certain laws and regulations had to be drawn-up to keep the ne
  2 CONC w settlement from deteriorating. For instance one guideline was that Indian land could not be purchased by any individual except for use by all its original purchasers. This would ensure a balanced ownership. The Colony of New Yor
  2 CONC k claimed jurisdiction over Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket and so it was with the Governor of New York, Francis Lovelace, that the Colony had to deal within terms of being recognized. By the summer of 1661, records show that the 
  2 CONC meetings were now being held on Nantucket indicating that many of the settlers had made the move to the Island. The first concerns of many were where their house lots would be located. At a town meeting held July 15, 1661 it was a
  2 CONC greed upon that each owner would have the freedom to choose his lot within limits not previously occupied. It was also decided that the lot size for each full share holder would be sixty rods square (a rod consisting of 16?"). It 
  2 CONC was also agreed that Tristram Coffyn would select first, in which he selected a lot on the north western coastline of the Island at a place known as Cappammet Harbour (today known as Capaum Pond). The original Nantucket record sta
  2 CONC tes "Tristram Coffyn, Sr., had his house lot laid out at Cappammet, by the aforesaid lot layers, at Cappamet Harbour head, sixty rods square, or thereabouts, the east side line part of it bounded by the highway; the south side by 
  2 CONC a rock southward of the pond; the north by the harbour head; the west side bounded by the lot of Tristram Coffin Jr." In the aftermath, once all was said and done, Tristram had succeeded with his wish to live out his days in a fre
  2 CONC e society surrounded by his friends and family, not unlike the communes that arose during the 1960's. To his east side, across Cappamet Harbour was his son Peter who didn't reside on the Island but was a frequent visitor seeing as
  2 CONC  he had secured the rights to supply the settlers with lumber for their homes. To the west was the lot of his son Tristram Jr., again not a full time resident but a frequent visitor. To the south laid the lots of his daughter Mary
  2 CONC  and her husband Nathaniel Starbuck. Mary and Nathaniel were very much a part of the Island's development. Mary owned the first store on the Island as well as being regarded in later life as a spiritual leader, having embraced Qua
  2 CONC kerism. Mary and Nathaniel also had the honour of having the first white baby on the Island during the early 1660's. Also to the south lay the lot of James Coffin. After Tristram, James was the head of the Coffin interests on Nant
  2 CONC ucket. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT The first years of settlement consisted of building houses along with shelters for their livestock, mainly sheep and oxen, as well as developing pastures and common buildings. The Indians helped to develop the farms and taught the
  2 CONC  settlers a great deal about living on the Island. In turn they were given employment and some formal education. The first years were often regarded as the best years upon Nantucket, in terms of creating a society that flowed in h
  2 CONC armony, where one could rely on their neighbours as though they were family. The great grandson of Thomas Macy would later write, "The little community was kind and courteous to each other and hospitable to strangers. The prevalen
  2 CONC ce of good feeling was remarked and felt by all who came among them". 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT From the beginning Tristram Coffyn and Thomas Macy were the spokesmen for the settlement. In 1671 they were selected by the group to go to New York and meet with Governor Lovelace and secure their claim to the Island. Upon their r
  2 CONC eturn the Islanders nominated Coffyn to be Chief Magistrate of Nantucket. The town also selected all other officers except the Chief Military Officer who was to be selected by Governor Lovelace from nominees chosen by the settleme
  2 CONC nt. After a few more years of harmony, or about the early 1670's the first signs of trouble on the Island began to appear. The problems came through the evolution of the two classes of settlers. On one hand they had the full share
  2 CONC  owners and their partners, who by Nantucket law had two votes each. On the other hand the half share owners only had one vote resulting in less of a say on Island affairs. They viewed themselves just as important as the full shar
  2 CONC e settler. The only thing missing for a revolt by the half share members was a leader. That changed in 1673 when it was decided that the community needed to expand their fishing interests by enlisting the services of a skilled tra
  2 CONC desman by the name of John Gardner of Salem, Massachusetts. Gardner was the brother of full share owner Joseph Gardner. Right from the start John Gardner challenged the original owners on most issues and from this began the feud b
  2 CONC etween the Gardners and the Coffins. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Another problem arising on the Island involved the Indians and liquor. Some of the white settlers were taking advantage of the Indians' ignorance regarding liquor consumption. Laws had to eventually be implemented prohibiting the 
  2 CONC sale and consumption of alcohol to Indians. John Gardner often ignored these laws which escalated the tension on the Island. Gardner also attempted to buy land from the Indians, however the final blow most probably resulted from a
  2 CONC  meeting Gardner set up with Gov. Lovelace's replacement, Governor Francis Andros. One of the requirements of the Islanders was to pay taxes to New York. This payment was met by giving the government four barrels of fish. John Gar
  2 CONC dner convinced the settlers to let him deliver the payment. While there, he met with Governor Andros and in turn convinced the Governor to name the main town in Nantucket, Sherborne, after his home town back in England. He then ma
  2 CONC naged to get himself appointed as Chief Military Officer. This all came about shortly before the Dutch takeover of New York. With the change in governments in New York, Gardners's group declared that past arrangements with the ori
  2 CONC ginal settlers were no longer valid. The tension ran high for a short period until the Dutch were run out of New York and the old government was reinstated. Upon this action, Tristram and Mathew Mayhew, grandson of Thomas, once ag
  2 CONC ain sailed for New York and had their agreements with the government reinstated. 
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In 1676 Thomas Mayhew became Chief Magistrate on Nantucket with Peter Coffin, a new resident on the Island becoming Assistant Magistrate. Peter and James Coffin had returned to the Island as a result of the conflict on the mainlan
  2 CONC d between the Indians and the white settlers known as King Philip's War. This appointment of Macy and the election of Peter Coffin infuriated the Gardner group. Not only was Peter a "Coffin" he also held government positions back 
  2 CONC in Dover and was not considered a full time resident of Nantucket. A few years later the tension eased with the elections of James Coffin, John Gardner and Nathaniel Starbuck who would all be elected as Assistant Magistrates. The 
  2 CONC feud continued toward the late 1670's in a period that would result in Tristram Coffyn being selected as Chief Magistrate by Governor Andros in the hopes of trying to pull the community back together. Coffyn was regarded by most o
  2 CONC f the settlers as the one person who could rectify Nantucket's struggle with growth. Unfortunately, for everyone, a shipwreck on the Nantucket shoals diverted any plans that Tristram had for the Islanders. In September 1678 a Fren
  2 CONC ch ship ran aground during a storm, forcing the crew to abandon ship. Shortly thereafter the cargo was salvaged by certain parties and sold for profit. This action put Tristram, who was chief magistrate, in violation with maritime
  2 CONC  law which stated that the cargo should have been secured until claimed by the owner. In failing to do so, Tristram subjected himself to be responsible for the lost cargo. The courts came down hard on him with a stiff penalty whic
  2 CONC h would ruin him financially. The action cast a dark cloud over Coffyn, who was now in his early 70's. His family rallied to his side but the strain of the penalty along with the feuding years had worn him down. His son James made
  2 CONC  financial arrangements to pay the fine. In the end, surprisingly, it was John Gardner, who had become the new Chief Magistrate of Nantucket, who stood up to the courts with a touching appeal on Coffyn's behalf. He convinced the c
  2 CONC ourts to reduce the penalty substantially.

  2 CONT ''Historical Note:'' Tristram Coffyn (as he signed his name), founder of the Coffin family line in America, was born at Brixton, Devonshire County, England in 1605. He married Dionis Stevens, also of Brixton, in 1642 and emigrated
  2 CONC  to America with his wife, five small children , his widowed mother, and two unmarried sisters. He lived alternately in Salisbury, Haverhill and Newbury, in the colony of Massachusetts, until 1660 when he came to Nantucket, part o
  2 CONC f which he, along with eight other men, had purchased from Thomas Mayhew, Sr. then under the jurisdiction of New York, and made arrangements for the purchase of the Island by a group of men whom he organized at Salisbury. Later th
  2 CONC at year, he brought his family to the Island and remained there until his death in 1681. Tristram Coffyn was the leading spirit among the Islanders at the commencement of the settlement, and the interests which he and his sons and
  2 CONC  sons-in-law represented gave him power to control to a great degree the enterprises of the Island. Among the sons of Tristram was the Hon. James Coffin (1640-1720) who served as Judge of the Probate Court. Mary (Coffin) Starbuck 
  2 CONC (1645- 1717), daughter of Tristram, participated in town meetings and was consulted on all matters of public importance. In 1701, she became a member of the Society of Friends and held the first Quaker meeting on Nantucket in her 
  2 CONC home. Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin (1759-1839), Baronet, was the fifth generation from Tristram. Perhaps his most beneficial and philanthropic act was the founding of the Coffin School at Nantucket. Many of the Nantucket Coffins made 
  2 CONC whaling voyages; others became involved in local political events and land transactions. Several emigrated to North Carolina, New York and California, drawn by dreams of rich farm lands or gold.

  2 CONT Tristram and his family plus his mother and his two sisters had moved to Newbury by 1647. Tristram was authorized by the General Court to, "keep an ordinary and also a ferry" to carry passengers from Newbury to Salisbury. By 1652,
  2 CONC  he was taxed in Salisbury where he signed his name "Commissioner of Salisbury" until 1660. In Salisbury, Tristram, along with Peter Folger, organized a company of 10 proprietors for the purchase and settlement of Nantucket. On 2 
  2 CONC July 1659, they agreed to purchase nine-tenths of the island from Gov. Thomas Mayhew for 10 pounds and other considerations plus two beaver hats, one for Mayhew, the other for his wife. At the time, beaver hats were the fashion in
  2 CONC  Europe and in America. The ten proprietors included our ancestors Christopher Hussey and Stephen Greenleaf. Stephen was Tristram's son-in-law. In July 1661, house lots were awarded and Tristram Coffin was given first choice. For 
  2 CONC many years, Tristram lived there and he with his son, Peter, held controlling interest in the island. At that time, Nantucket was under the jurisdiction of New York and Tristram was appointed "Governor" of the island in 1671 (Alba
  2 CONC ny Deeds, vol 3:62). Two years later his commission is found in the Massachusetts Records. He held this office until 1680.

  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram was the eldest son of Peter Coffin and his wife Joan Kember, and was born at Brixton, a parish near Plymouth in Devon; he was baptised on 11 March 1610. He became a churchwarden of the parish church (where his customary p
  2 CONC ew in the front of the chancel was marked on a plan made in 1638) and also a parish constable - holder of one of the offices created under the Elizabethan reforms of parochial administration. In 1630 or thereabouts he married Dion
  2 CONC is, daughter of Robert Stevens of the same parish.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram may have inherited some property from his father, as he was the executor both of Peter and of his uncle John, whose will was proved in 1628. Records of Devon Quarter Sessions show that he had a legal dispute with a Thomas
  2 CONC  Maynard, also of Brixton, which in midsummer 1641 was referred for arbitration to Robert Savery and Henry Pollexfen. The subject of the dispute and the outcome of the arbitration are not known. But they may have had a bearing on 
  2 CONC Tristram's decision in 1642, shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War in England, to embark for America - taking with him his wife and 5 small children, his mother and two unmarried sisters. None of them ever returned. It is th
  2 CONC ought that they sailed in one of four ships owned by Robert Clement (the Hector, Griffin, Job Clement and Margaret Clement).
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram is said to have gone first to Salisbury, in what is now Massachusetts, but to have moved soon afterwards to the new settlement of Pentucket (later renamed Haverhill). Later still he moved to Newbury, and then back to Sali
  2 CONC sbury (1654-5), from where he set out first to Martha's Vineyard and then to Nantucket, intending (it is said) to report on the disposition of the Indians and the possibility of emigrating thither. His report was satisfactory on a
  2 CONC ll counts.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT On his return to Salisbury in 1659, a company was organised for the purchase of Nantucket, and the first settlers arrived later that year - Thomas Macy and his family, Edward Starbuck, Isaac Coleman and James Coffin (Tristram's fo
  2 CONC urth child, and only 19 years of age at the time).Tristram himself seems to have moved to the island in 1660, and to have been given some priority in choosing his house lot at a meeting in July 1661, when it was agreed among the f
  2 CONC irst purchasers that each should be free to choose a lot of 60 rods square. According to Louis Coffin, author of The Coffin Family, his first home was near the Capaum pond, where he lived until his death.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Of the other members of Tristram's family, his mother Joan died in Boston in May 1661, and never went to Nantucket. His eldest son Peter was among the original purchasers, and like his father was allotted land near Capaum; but if 
  2 CONC he lived there, it seems to have been only for a short time. Two of Tristram's other children, Tristram Jr. and Elizabeth, were (like Peter) married by this time; but although among the original purchasers, Tristram Jr. and Elizab
  2 CONC eth and her husband (Stephen Greenleaf), are not thought to have ever lived on Nantucket. However, James Coffin, the third son, was allotted land bounded on the west by the common, and on the south by the lot of Nathaniel Starbuck
  2 CONC . Tristram Sr. and his three eldest sons also bought the neighbouring island of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckernuck_Island '''Tuckernuck'''] in their own right.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT According to the early accounts, Tristram Coffin Sr. was the leading man on the island, and notably so in his dealings with the American Indians who were its aboriginal inhabitants.He is said to have treated them considerately in 
  2 CONC all ways, and to have employed numbers of them in farming the land he acquired. However, some white settlers foolishly sold rum to the Indians, who soon became drunk and troublesome as a result. As the first chief magistrate of th
  2 CONC e island, appointed in 1671, Tristram (with his opposite number from Martha's Vineyard, Thomas Mayhew) had to promulgate a law prohibiting the sale to Indians of intoxicating drink - perhaps the first liquor law on record.

  2 CONT Coffyn's early years in England were during a very eventful time. Intellectual freedom was being claimed as a right for each individual. This period was during the reign of James I. Among the names of the day were William Shakespe
  2 CONC are, Francis Bacon and Oliver Cromwell. It was a period when the Puritans were making large gains in the Parliament.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram had one younger brother, John and four sisters, Johanna, Deborah, Eunice and Mary. When Tristram was 19 his father Peter, died. His will was dated December 21, 1627 and was proved by his widow Johanna on March 13, 1628. I
  2 CONC n the will it was declared that Tristram was to be provided for according to his degree and calling. Tristram was a farmer and therefore most likely took control of his fathers estate near Plymouth. Two years later Tristram courte
  2 CONC d and wed Dionis Stevens, daughter of Robert Stevens of Brixton. Dionis Stevens was born in 1609 although other accounts say 1613. Shortly after their marriage, their first child Peter was born in 1631 followed by their son Tristr
  2 CONC am Jr., born in 1632. During the early 1630's England entered into a storm of conflict with the death of James I and the succession of Charles I. In 1638 the Scots took up arms against the King. The Presbyterians took control of t
  2 CONC he Commons and this was followed by an all out civil war in 1642. During this period of time Tristram and Dionis had two more children Elizabeth (d.o.b. unknown) and James born August 12, 1639. Dionis was also pregnant with their 
  2 CONC fifth child.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In 1640 Coffyn was selected as a Warden of Brixton Parish. Shortly after in November 1640, he leased his farm that was located at Butlass. With the civil war closing in on his family and the wounding and eventual death eight days 
  2 CONC later of his brother John at Plymouth Fort, Tristram decided to take his family, including his mother and two unwed sisters to safety in Colonial America. Tristram's friend Robert Clement was leaving for America shortly, aboard a 
  2 CONC small fleet of ships, some of which were owned by Clement. Tristram quickly put his affairs in order and embarked on his journey with his family aboard Clement's ship named "Hector Clement" in the spring of 1642. This proved to be
  2 CONC  the last time Coffyn was to see his home in England.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT The crossing of the Atlantic took between 60 and 90 days before they arrived in Newburyport Massachusetts, during the summer of 1642. It was a mere twenty years since the pilgrims, aboard the Mayflower had landed at Plymouth. Shor
  2 CONC tly after their arrival, Tristram secured living quarters for his family and started exploring up the Merrimack River with Robert Clement in search of a good location for a more permanent home. He arrived in a soon to be called se
  2 CONC ttlement named Pentucket, now known as Haverhill Ma. The book "The History of Haverhill" by George Chase states that Clements son, Job Clements had already settled in the area a year earlier, if so, this could be the reason that C
  2 CONC offyn and Clements chose this area. They found the area to have fertile soil with the necessary resources to build a farm, however, it was recorded that the large population of wolves were a problem with the flocks of sheep and a 
  2 CONC guard had to be posted at all times.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In 1641 there were only six homes built in Pentucket. Tristram's group of settlers negotiated with the Indians for the property rights and secured a large area for the sum of three pounds ten shillings. A copy of this deed is stil
  2 CONC l on record and bares witness to the signatures of Robert Clement and Tristram Coffyn, dated November 15, 1642. Not only is this the first record of the first Coffin immigrant in America, but it also indicates how Tristram spelled
  2 CONC  his surname, Coffyn, with a "y" instead of an "i". It was also during this period that John, their youngest child fell ill and died. Dionis was also pregnant with their sixth child who was later named Deborah. She was born the fi
  2 CONC rst Coffin child in America, and the third child born in the tiny settlement but was destined for the same fate as the other newborns and died three weeks later. These deaths give evidence to the harsh conditions that the first im
  2 CONC migrants must have encountered upon their arrival in the new world. The living conditions were primitive and unforgiving and many families suffered greatly. It was noted that Coffyn was the first white settler to plough land in th
  2 CONC e area, having made his own plough from materials at hand.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT A few years after his arrival in Pentucket, his daughter Mary was born, becoming the first Coffin child to be born and survive to adulthood in America. Shortly after Coffyn's arrival, the settlement was threatened when Indian war 
  2 CONC parties decided to target the settlers homes. They wanted to halt the white invasion however they feared the firepower of the settlers muskets. The Indian plan was to send a small group to each of the settlers homes at the same ti
  2 CONC me and gain entrance to the houses by way of presenting goods for trade. Upon a predetermined signal, the Indians would jump the white men, cut their throats and ransack the house looking for weapons. What the Indians didn't know 
  2 CONC was that one of their members was a Colonial informant who revealed the plan to British intelligence and the British soldiers, along with about forty settlers disarmed the Indians before they could set the plan in motion.

  2 CONT
  2 CONT After only a few years of farming in Pentucket, Tristram embarked on a new direction. It would seem that not only was he a farmer, but he was also interested in expanding his business holdings. When the opportunity arose to operat
  2 CONC e a ferry back in Newbury, Tristram decided to move his family once again. The History of Newbury states that in 1644 Tristram Coffin Sr. is allowed to keep an Ordinary (Tavern) which consisted of selling wine and keeping a ferry 
  2 CONC and Inn on the Newbury side of the Merrimack River. George Carr kept a ferry on the Salisbury side across from Carr Island. Tristram's ferry crossed from Newbury on the south side of the river, between Carr Island and Ram Island, 
  2 CONC over to the north side to the town of Salisbury. The ferry was most likely a tow ferry with oxen providing the power to pull the craft across the river, with his sons helping to load and disembark the passengers. In the 1650's Tri
  2 CONC stram's eldest children began to expand their horizons with Peter leaving Newbury to go to Dover, New Hampshire, where he became involved in the lumber business along with holding a variety of public office positions. Tristram's d
  2 CONC aughter Elizabeth wed Stephen Greenleaf in 1651 and resided in Newbury where the couple eventually had ten children before Elizabeth's early death. Tristram Jr. married Judith Somerby in 1653 and became a weaver/tailor and Deacon 
  2 CONC of the First Parish of Newbury. Tristram Jr. is also the person who brought the Coffin name to the old Coffin house in 1654, which still stands in Newbury, after housing over 240 years of Coffin descendants.

  2 CONT Coffin Family Papers, 1661- 1962
  2 CONT Historical Note: Tristram Coffyn (as he signed his name), founder of the Coffin family line in America, was born at Brixton, Devonshire County, England in 1605. He married Dionis Stevens, also of Brixton, in 1642 and emigrated to 
  2 CONC America with his wife, five small children , his widowed mother, and two unmarried sisters. He lived alternately in Salisbury, Haverhill and Newbury, in the colony of Massachusetts, until 1660 when he came to Nantucket, part of wh
  2 CONC ich he, along with eight other men, had purchased from Thomas Mayhew, Sr. then under the jurisdiction of New York, and made arrangements for the purchase of the Island by a group of men whom he organized at Salisbury. Later that y
  2 CONC ear, he brought his family to the Island and remained there until his death in 1681. Tristram Coffyn was the leading spirit among the Islanders at the commencement of the settlement, and the interests which he and his sons and son
  2 CONC s-in-law represented gave him power to control to a great degree the enterprises of the Island. Among the sons of Tristram was the Hon. James Coffin (1640-1720) who served as Judge of the Probate Court. Mary (Coffin) Starbuck (164
  2 CONC 5- 1717), daughter of Tristram, participated in town meetings and was consulted on all matters of public importance. In 1701, she became a member of the Society of Friends and held the first Quaker meeting on Nantucket in her home
  2 CONC . Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin (1759-1839), Baronet, was the fifth generation from Tristram. Perhaps his most beneficial and philanthropic act was the founding of the Coffin School at Nantucket. Many of the Nantucket Coffins made whal
  2 CONC ing voyages; others became involved in local political events and land transactions. Several emigrated to North Carolina, New York and California, drawn by dreams of rich farm lands or gold.
  2 CONT ----------
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Tristram and his family plus his mother and his two sisters had moved to Newbury by 1647. Tristram was authorized by the General Court to, "keep an ordinary and also a ferry" to carry passengers from Newbury to Salisbury. By 1652,
  2 CONC  he was taxed in Salisbury where he signed his name "Commissioner of Salisbury" until 1660. In Salisbury, Tristram, along with Peter Folger, organized a company of 10 proprietors for the purchase and settlement of Nantucket. On 2 
  2 CONC July 1659, they agreed to purchase nine-tenths of the island from Gov. Thomas Mayhew for 10 pounds and other considerations plus two beaver hats, one for Mayhew, the other for his wife. At the time, beaver hats were the fashion in
  2 CONC  Europe and in America. The ten proprietors included our ancestors Christopher Hussey and Stephen Greenleaf. Stephen was Tristram's son-in-law. In July 1661, house lots were awarded and Tristram Coffin was given first choice. For 
  2 CONC many years, Tristram lived there and he with his son, Peter, held controlling interest in the island. At that time, Nantucket was under the jurisdiction of New York and Tristram was appointed "Governor" of the island in 1671 (Alba
  2 CONC ny Deeds, vol 3:62). Two years later his commission is found in the Massachusetts Records. He held this office until 1680.

  2 CONT Peter Folger (1617–1690) was a poet and is more commonly known as the maternal Grandfather of Benjamin Franklin, and was instrumental in the colonization of Nantucket Island in the Massachusetts colony.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Peter Folger was born in Norfolk, England, son of John Folger, in 1617. He came to America in 1635 with his father, settling initially in Watertown, Massachusetts, and later moving to Martha's Vineyard, where he worked as a teache
  2 CONC r and surveyor. In 1644 He married Mary Morrill, whom he may have met on the voyage from England.  At the Vineyard Folger supported himself by teaching school and surveying land. He also worked with Thomas Mayhew to convert the na
  2 CONC tive American population to Christianity, during which time he learned to speak the native language.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT From time to time between 1659 and 1662, Folger journeyed to Nancucket in order to survey it for the proprietors. In 1663 Folger moved to Nantucket full time, having been granted a half a share of land by the proprietors, where he
  2 CONC  was a surveyor, an Indian interpretor, and clerk in the courts. Shortly thereafter, Folger's daughter, Abiah, was born, later to become the mother of Benjamin Franklin.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT A Baptist missionary, teacher, and surveyor his dealings with the native population promoted harmony between the Native Americans and European settlers. His grandson, Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, son of Peter's daughter Abia
  2 CONC h, referred to him fondly in his autobiography.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Folger died at Nantucket, Massachusetts in 1690. His wife Mary lived until 1704.

  2 CONT
  2 CONT When John passed away in 1665 his will excluded his only son Peter, which suggests their relationship may not have been ideal.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Peter himself by that time had moved away to Nantucket and had his own success. Besides a large and thriving family (9 children), Peter kept busy by working as a surveyor, miller, schoolteacher, machinist, blacksmith, eyeglass mak
  2 CONC er, published author (and poet), interpreter and preacher (sounds a lot like his grandson Benjamin!).
  2 CONT
  2 CONT To fulfill his duties as a Baptist preacher – he converted to this very Flemish form of worship (a logical evolution of the Anabaptists) after arriving in the New World – Peter Folger mastered the Wampanoag language to better prea
  2 CONC ch to the native Americans around Nantucket. He espoused religious and ethnic tolerance (in an age of witchcraft trials), demonstrated personal bravery during King Philip’s War (without carrying weapons) and was several times elec
  2 CONC ted to serve as clerk of the court. He was esteemed by his neighbors, jailed for sticking up for the rights of others, respected by the Indians (who called him “white-chief’s old young-man” in recognition of his judiciousness and 
  2 CONC thoughtful demeanor), and especially adored by his youngest daughter, Abiah.

  2 CONT Biography
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Folger, Peter (1617-1690), interpreter and public official in America, was born in Norwich, the son of John Folger and Meriba Gibbs. Little is known of Folger until 1635, when he and his widower father immigrated to Massachusetts.
  2 CONC  They sailed on the ship Abigail. During the voyage Folger met Mary Morrill, an indentured servant, and apparently fell in love for he spent the next nine years of his life working as a weaver, miller, surveyor, and shoemaker to r
  2 CONC aise the £20 to buy out her contract and marry her in 1644. Mary had to obtain release from the indenture that bound her by the payment of 20 English pounds, a very large sum in those days. It took all Peter Folger had saved in ni
  2 CONC ne years in the New World, plus all that he could borrow from his father, to secure the liberty of Mary. Throughout his life Peter Folger always boasted that the purchase of his Mary's indenture was the best bargain he had ever ob
  2 CONC tained.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT The couple had nine children that survived infancy. During the 1640s the family moved to Martha's Vineyard, an island settlement that was effectively ruled by the senior and junior Thomas Mayhew. There Folger began a long and pros
  2 CONC perous career as an interpreter and cultural intermediary with the American Indian population. At the Mayhews' puritan mission he evangelized the native inhabitants and mastered Algonquian, a major Amerindian language family that 
  2 CONC would have enabled communication with the vast majority of American Indians in New England. About 1648 the younger Thomas Mayhew extended the mission to nearby Nantucket Island, part of the Mayhew proprietorship, which was home to
  2 CONC  several thousand American Indians. In 1659 Folger, who was by then familiar with the island through his missionary work, aided a group of white settlers who had purchased the island from the younger Thomas Mayhew in surveying Nan
  2 CONC tucket. That same year Folger also publicly declared himself a Baptist at a Martha's Vineyard town meeting, which undoubtedly agitated the puritan Mayhews and prompted Folger to move to the more tolerant colony of Rhode Island.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In 1663 Folger returned to Nantucket at the request of the island's proprietors in order to soothe worsening tensions with the native population that had arisen mainly from the interference of the white settlement's cattle with Am
  2 CONC erindian crops. As an enticement he was awarded a half share in the proprietorship (full shares were reserved for families of original white settlers). Nantucket was something of an anomaly in the puritan New England context in th
  2 CONC at established religion did not gain a substantial foothold among the whites until the eighteenth century. The only churches on the island in Folger's time, therefore, were found among the American Indians. In such tolerance Folge
  2 CONC r comfortably settled his family, acted as an intermediary with the American Indians, and continued his highly successful evangelizing efforts. He also worked as a teacher, surveyor, miller, and farmer, and even served as the cler
  2 CONC k of courts.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Folger's greatest triumph as chief diplomat to the American Indians came in 1665, when Metacom 'King Philip', arrived with a number of his warriors in pursuit of John Gibbs. Gibbs, an Amerindian from Nantucket who had recently fin
  2 CONC ished his studies at Harvard, had insulted the powerful Pokanoket sachem by publicly speaking his father's name, Massasoit, which was an offence punishable by death. Gibbs was most likely a close friend of Folger, who had baptized
  2 CONC  the American Indian and given him the Christian name John Gibbs, which was the name of Folger's maternal grandfather. Neither the Amerindian nor the white population (about 100 people) was in a position to thwart Metacom through 
  2 CONC force, but Folger intervened to save Gibbs, offering his pursuer a ransom in exchange for Gibbs's life. Metacom agreed, but the people of Nantucket were only able to raise £11-significantly less than he wanted. An angry Metacom th
  2 CONC reatened to destroy the settlement, but the islanders called his bluff, threatening to attack him unless he departed, which he promptly did. A decade later Metacom led a coalition of Amerindians against New England in what became 
  2 CONC known as King Philip's War. The brutal fighting saw extensive slaughter and murder on both sides, but did not touch Nantucket.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Folger died on Nantucket Island in 1690. He was survived by a substantial family that would produce a number of prominent American scientists, merchants, and politicians, the most famous of whom was Benjamin Franklin, Folger's gra
  2 CONC ndson.

  2 CONT The ship was the Abigail, out of Plymouth England, bound for the new world, and the lovers were Peter Folger and Mary Morrill. Peter, then 18 years old,was proficient in mathematics, writing and history and he hoped that his acade
  2 CONC mic training at Norwich Grammer School would enable him to get a job as a clerk to Thomas Mayhew at Watertown, Massachusetts. His father, John Folger, had worked as a mason, carpenter, and cabinetmaker in Norfolkshire and now, wit
  2 CONC h the death of his wife, Meriah Gibbs, earlier in the same year, had embarded on this voyage to the New England Colonies. Mary Morrill was an orphan girl "bound out" to Hugh Peters and  his wife. Her indenture had been purchased b
  2 CONC y Hugh Peters for 20 pounds (roughly $100) and she must serve the Peters family for a given number of years until the indenture expired or was purchased by another. Hugh Peters was a well known independent preacher whose unorthodo
  2 CONC x teachings brought him into conflict with authorities in England and later, in Holland, where he had fled to escape persecution. The voyage in the Abigail offered him the opportunity to voice his opinions in a new climate. He was
  2 CONC  headed for Salem Massachusets where he was to assume the pastorate of the church. Upon reaching the new world the lovers found themselves widely seperated, Peter in Watertown and Mary in Salem. HughPeters and his wife were kind t

  2 CONC y saving but at last Peter purchased Mary's indenture and the couple were married on June 23, 1644. Peter and Mary began their married life on Martha's Vineyard where Peter taught school and where he became deeply involved in Indi
  2 CONC an affairs. He learned the Algonquin Indian language and converted many of the Indians to Christianity. The Indians called him "Shite Chief'sYoung Old Man." In 1659 Peter was asked by a group of men to act as surveyor in a project
  2 CONC  for developing a settlement on Nantucket Island.  He helped to lay out the house lots for the village of Nantucket and to establish boundary lines between land to be owned by the white settlers and that to be retained by the Indi
  2 CONC ans. Later, he served the small community as a weaver, surveyor, blacksmith, keeper of Island records and interpreter of the Indian language.  He also found time to write and publish poetry.  Peter was a man of principal. His stub

  2 CONT    leave these few lines with thee,
  2 CONT Hoping that in the substance we
  2 CONT    shall very well agree.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT If that you do mistake the verse
  2 CONT    for its uncomely dress,
  2 CONT I tell thee true, I never thought
  2 CONT    that it would pass the press.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT If any at the matter kick,
  2 CONT    it's like he's galled at heart,
  2 CONT And that's the reason why he kicks,
  2 CONT    because he finds it smart.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT I am for peace, and not for war,
  2 CONT    And that's the reason why,
  2 CONT I write more plain than some men do,
  2 CONT    That use to daub and lie.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT But I shall cease, and set my name
  2 CONT    To what I here insert;
  2 CONT Because, to be a libeller,
  2 CONT    I hate it with my heart.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT From Sherbon town, where now I dwell,
  2 CONT    My name I do put here;
  2 CONT Without offence, your real friend,
  2 CONT    It is Peter Folger

  2 CONT Peter Folger and Mary Morrell
  2 CONT
  2 CONT     Peter Folger was born, according to Sparks, in 1617. He was the son of John Folger and, perhaps, Meribah Gibbs. According to tradition, Peter came to America with his father in 1635 from Norwich, Norfolk, England. He settled a
  2 CONC t Watertown, Middlesex, Massachusetts and then Martha’s Vineyard, Dukes, Massachusetts. He was a missionary and interpreter among the Indians there.
  2 CONT Peter married Mary Morrell in 1644. According to tradition, which has been disputed, Mary was an indentured servant of Hugh Peters, Peter “bought her” by paying off her indenture, and Peter stated that she was “the best appropriat
  2 CONC ion of money he had ever made”.
  2 CONT     Around 1663, the Folgers moved to the Island of Nantucket (Massachusetts), where he was among the first settlers. According to Sparks, Peter was “a man of considerable learning, particularly in mathematical science” and was a 
  2 CONC surveyor in both Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket, becoming one of the five commissioners appointed to measure and lay out land on Nantucket. He was a teacher, was “not only well informed in theology, but in political affairs”, ser
  2 CONC ved as a clerk of the courts, and supposedly preached (as a Baptist) from time to time.
  2 CONT     Sigourney and Mooney report that Peter was “called ‘white chief’s old-young man’ by the Nantucket Indians, meaning he was wise for his age.” Sparks quotes one Mr. Prince, who mentioned “an able and godly Englishman, named Pete
  2 CONC r Foulger, employed in teaching the youth in reading, writing, and the principles of religion by catechizing; being well learned likewise in the Scriptures, and capable of helping them in religious matters.” Cotton Mather called P
  2 CONC eter “a godly, learned Englishman”. Peter wrote poetry, including A Looking-Glass for Our Times.
  2 CONT     Mary was said to have “widened out in later years” and that, because of that, she had a special chair she carried with her when she visited her neighbors.
  2 CONT Peter died in 1690 and Mary died in 1704.

  2 CONT
  2 CONT    There is a tradition in the family, that John Folger, and his son Peter Folger, (the name was then written Foulger) crossed the Atlantic in the same vessel with Hugh Peters, in the year 1635. They came from Norwich, in the coun
  2 CONC ty of Norfolk, England. Peter was then eighteen years old, and of course was born in the year 1617. The father and son settled at Martha’s Vineyard. The time is not exactly known, but it is supposed to have been very soon after th
  2 CONC ey came to the country. It has not been ascertained whether John Folger’s wife came with him, or whether she had died in England, and he married again in America. The name of his wife, Meribell, is mentioned in the records of Mart
  2 CONC ha’s Vineyard. He died about 1660. His wife was living in 1663. Peter was his only child.
  2 CONT     In the year 1644, Peter Folger married Mary Morrell, who had been an inmate in Hugh Peters’s family. He resided at Martha’s Vineyard till 1663, when he removed to Nantucket, being among the first settlers of that Island. He wa
  2 CONC s a man of considerable learning, particularly in mathematical science, and he practised surveying both in the Vineyard and Nantucket. He was one of the five commissioners first appointed to measure and lay out the land on the Isl
  2 CONC and of Nantucket; and it was said in the order, that “whatsoever shall be done by them or any three of them, Peter Folger being one, shall be accounted legal and valid.” This mode of wording the order shows the confidence that was
  2 CONC  placed in his integrity and judgment.
  2 CONT     He acquired the Indian language, and served as interpreter, both in affairs of business, and in communicating religious instruction to the Indians. He rendered assistance in this way to the Reverend Thomas Mayhew, the distingu
  2 CONC ished missionary at Martha’s Vineyard. Mr. Prince, in his account of Mayhew, says, that he had “an able and godly Englishman, named Peter Foulger, employed in teaching the youth in reading, writing, and the principles of religion 
  2 CONC by catechizing; being well learned likewise in the Scriptures, and capable of helping them in religious matters.”[6] He is said to have preached on some occasions. There is a long letter from him to his son-in-law, Joseph Pratt, c
  2 CONC ontaining religious counsel, with much use of Scripture, according to the practice of those times. Indeed his poem, entitled A Looking-Glass for the Times, published in 1676, shows that he was not only well informed in theology, b
  2 CONC ut in political affairs, such as they then were in New England. He died in 1690, and his widow in 1704.
  2 CONT     The children of Peter and Mary Folger were, 1. Johannah, who married John Coleman. 2. Bethiah, married John Barnard, February, 1668-9. They were both drowned four months afterwards by the upsetting of a boat, while crossing fr
  2 CONC om Nantucket. to the Vineyard. 3. Dorcas, married Joseph Pratt 4. Eleazer born 1648, married Sarah Gardner. 5. Bethshua, married — Pope. 6. Patience, married Ebenezer Harker. 7. John, born 1659, married Mary Barnard. 8. Experience
  2 CONC , married John Swain 9. Abiah, born August 15th, 1667, married Josiah Franklin.
  2 CONT     Joseph Pratt lived at one time in Nantucket, but is supposed to have removed to Boston. Some of the descendants of Pope also lived in Boston. John Pope was a physician of some eminence. Joseph Pope was ingenious in mechanics, 
  2 CONC and constructed the orrery in Harvard College. Robert Pope was a watchmaker, skilful in his art. The other children of Peter Folger and their descendants have nearly all resided in Nantucket. A son of Eleazer, of the same name, se
  2 CONC rved as register of probate forty-seven years, and died in 1753, aged eighty-one. He was succeeded by his son Frederick, who held the same office thirty-seven years, and died in 1790, at the age of sixty-five. Peleg, a brother of 
  2 CONC Frederick, wrote many pieces in prose and verse, and was distinguished for his piety and estimable character; he died in 1789, aged fifty-five. Nathan, another son of the first Eleazer, had several children. His son Abisha was jus
  2 CONC tice of the peace, and for thirty years represented the town in the legislature. Barzillai, another son of Nathan, commanded a vessel in the London trade. Abisha had a large family of children. Among them were William, George, and
  2 CONC  Timothy; the last of whom was justice of the peace and a merchant. He took an active part with the patriots at the beginning of the Revolution. There is a portrait of him by Copley. Barzillai likewise had many children. Among the
  2 CONC m was Walter, a man of great strength of mind, of strict probity and honor, a good mathematician, at one time commander of a vessel, and for many years a merchant and ship-owner. He died much respected in 1826, in the ninety-secon
  2 CONC d year of his age. His son, Walter Folger, known as the astronomer of Nantucket, was born in 1765, and is still living (in 1839). Many years ago be invented and constructed a very ingenious astronomical clock. He also made a teles
  2 CONC cope with a magnifying power of about five hundred. The above are descendants of Eleazer, the son of Peter. His other son, John, had children, from whom have sprung descendants, but they are less known.

  2 CONT
  2 CONT Mary married Peter Folger in 1644. He had been one of the few white men in Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, Massachusetts (as a successor of Thomas Mayhew), and was a teacher and translator for the Wampanoag Indians. Peter Folger 
  2 CONC paid Hugh Peters the sum of 20 shillings to pay off Mary's servitude, which he declared was the best appropriation of money he had ever made. Their daughter, Abiah Folger (Benjamin Franklin's mother), was born on August 15, 1667 i

  2 CONT
  2 CONT >"They have something better than royal blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers an
  2 CONC d harpooneers--all kith and kin to noble Benjamin--this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other."

  2 CONT Biography
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Hon. James Coffin, the fourth child of Tristram Coffin and Dionis Stevens, was born in England on August 12, 1640 and died July 28, 1720,[1] aged 80 years, in Nantucket, Massachusetts. He married Mary Severence, a daughter of John
  2 CONC  and Abigail Severance, of Salisbury, Massachusetts, on December 3, 1663.[2][3] "He came to Nantucket with the first settlers, but subsequently removed to Dover, N. H., where he resided in 1668, being a member of the church there 
  2 CONC in 1671, and the same year, May 31, he was there made freeman. Soon after this date, however, he returned to Nantucket and resided there until his death. He filled several important public offices at Nantucket, among them Judge of
  2 CONC  the Probate Court. The first records of the Probate Office are under his administration. He was the father of fourteen children, all of whom, except two, grew to maturity and married. From him have descended, perhaps, the most re
  2 CONC markable representatives of the Coffin family, as doubtless the most numerous and generally scattered. This branch furnished the families that remained loyal to Great Britain in the American Revolution, and General John Coffin, as
  2 CONC  well as his brother, Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, rendered valiant service against the Colonies, for which they received in time their rewards, two sons of Gen. John now holding Admiral's commissions in the Royal Navy, one aged 88 a
  2 CONC nd the other 84 years, both hale and hearty' when last heard from. The most distinguished woman which America has produced, Lucretia Mott, was also descended from this line, her father, Thomas Coffin, being the 17th child of Benja
  2 CONC min, and not the youngest, either. "[4]

 1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Thomas Green was born 1606/07 in England, probably in Leicestershire [1]; (marriage source states b. 3 AUG 1600 St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England). Thomas's father was John Greene ...and Thomas's mother was Ann Sc
  2 CONC argell ... He arrived on the ship "Planter" in 1635/6[2] He married 26 JUN 1627 Hertfordshire, England as Thomas UNKNOWN to Wife Elizabeth Lynde. He died December 19, 1667 in Malden, Massachusetts (Middlesex) having had 5 sons and
  2 CONC  5 daughters. The first record extant of him is dated 1653, when his youngest daughter, Dorcas, was born, but it is exceedingly probable that he was an early settler in the Massachusetts Colony; that he remained temporarily in one
  2 CONC  of the new settlements until about 1649-50, when he removed to the northern part of Malden, now Melrose, where he secured his farm of sixty-three acres; that all his children lived with him or near him with the exception of daugh
  2 CONC ter Hannah, who married and lived in Woburn. It is certain that he lived in Malden, Massachusetts, as early as October 28, 1651, when his wife Elizabeth and daughter of the same name, signed a petition to the general court concern
  2 CONC ing the Rev. Marmaduke Matthews. A portion of his farm in Malden was still in the possession of some of his descendants two hundred years later. He was selectman of Malden in 1658, served several times on the Middlesex county gran
  2 CONC d jury and was known as Thomas Green(e)
  2 CONT
  2 CONT He is often called Thomas Greene, Sr., to distinguish him from his son, Thomas, Jr., and another Thomas Greene of the town, who had no suffix. His ten children who had been living near him commenced to separate about 1676. Four of
  2 CONC  his sons — Samuel, William, Nathaniel and Jabez — removed to Leicester, and their descendants are found to-day in every state in the Union. Another son, Henry, removed to Killingly, Connecticut, as did the children of his son Jac
  2 CONC ob. Another son, David, removed to Amherst, New Hampshire; two others, Jacob and Benjamin, to Hanover, New Jersey. Thomas Greene, Sr., in his will, dated November 12, 1667, does not mention any wife, but makes bequests to his "eld
  2 CONC est son" Thomas, to sons John, William, Henry, Samuel and to daughters Elizabeth, Mary, Hannah, Martha and Dorcas. This shows that all his children were living at the date of his death. Some of them were born in England, but it is
  2 CONC  not on record how many. His first marriage was to Elizabeth ————, who died August 22, 1658, and is believed to have been the mother of all his children. He married (second) Frances, born in 1608, widow of Richard Cook, previously
  2 CONC  widow of Isaac Wheeler, who had had children by her first two husbands.[3]
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Note: The Greene family of Amsterdam, New York, are descendants of Thomas Greene, of England, the final e of the name being dropped by the second generation in America. There were other families of the same name who settled in New
  2 CONC  England at an early date, and there were others by the name of Thomas. There was a Thomas who was on record in Roxbury in 1648; Thomas, who came in the "Speedwell" in 1636; and Thomas, of Middlesex. These must not be confounded w
  2 CONC ith the Thomas Greene, of Malden, who founded the family under consideration in this sketch. [11245 but Malden is in Middlesex}

  2 CONT The GENEALOGICAL AND FAMILY HISTORY OF THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, Vol. 2, page 467 states that James Barrett was born in England about 1615; the date of his coming to America is not given but he was an inhabitant of Charlestown,

  2 CONT
  2 CONT The surname Barrett belongs to an ancient and honored English family, whose progenitor came from Normandy with William the Conqueror in 1066, and his name is enrolled in Battle Abbey. The first record of the family in this country
  2 CONC  is of Robert Barrett, who was engaged in the Maine fisheries, which before permanent settlements were made had led to temporary settlements at Winter Harbor and Cape Porpoise as early as 1639 under Walter Barret and others from B
  2 CONC ristol England. According to good authority, it is said that James Barrett mentioned below and Robert Barrett of Charlestown, Massachusetts, were sons of John Barret, Sr. of Wells, Maine, and John Barrett was doubtless related to 
  2 CONC Walter and Robert Barrett mentioned above. Thomas Barrett settled in Braintree and Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and his grandson Moses settled on Woodstock, Connecticut, in the same section as descendants of James. It is likely that
  2 CONC  the Chelmsford and Charlestown-Malden Barretts were closely connected.

  2 CONT *'''   1. HENRY COLLINS, starchmaker, aged 29, with his wife Ann, aged 30, three children and five servants, came in the ship Abigail in June, 1635. They were certified from the parish of Stepney, England. Probably this was not th
  2 CONC eir home, but the place of their last sojourn in England. The servants were evidently his workmen in the business which it would seem he had been carrying on in England. 
  2 CONT *'''   He settled at Lynn. March 9, 1636-7, he was made ''freeman," which means he became a citizen of the colony, entitled to the privilege of voting and holding office in the colony. .... etc.

  2 CONT *'''  .... The will of Henry Collins cannot now be found, but it is referred to in probate records. It was dated February 10, 1686, and was probated March 31, 1687. Later an agreement was made by the sons to carry out the provisio
  2 CONC ns of the will, and this agreement is on file at Salem. 
  2 CONT *'''   Ann, the widow of Henry Collins''', died September 29, 1691. Her blindness, which she mentions in the following will, explains the fact that she was unable to sign her name, but made her mark instead. .... etc.

  2 CONC  the will of his father and was one of the brothers who made an agreement regarding the lands which their father had owned and bequeathed to them, in the year 1694. 
  2 CONT *   He was a housewright, or carpenter and builder. He lived at Lynn and owned considerable land. February 20, 1721-2, he deeded land and buildings to his son Ezekiel, on condition of Ezekiel's taking care of himself and wife and

  2 CONT Colonel Richard Waterman, immigrant ancestor and founder of the Waterman family of New England, was a passenger to America in the fleet with Higginson in the year 1629, and having been sent as an expert hunter by the Governor and 
  2 CONC Company of Massachusetts Bay, although tradition brought forward at various times has stated that he came in the same ship with Roger Williams, with whom he later joined his fortunes. The family bore coat-of-arms as follows:
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Arms -- Or a buck's head cabossed gules.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Richard Waterman settled in Salem, Mass., where he became a member of the church. He soon fell into disrepute in the Salem settlement because of his sympathy with the views of Roger Williams, and in March, 1638, followed Roger Wil
  2 CONC liams to Providence, having been banished from Salem. In Providence in the same year he was the twelfth among those to whom were granted equal shares of the land that Williams received from Canonicus and Miantonomi. After a period
  2 CONC  of years he joined with Randall Holden, Samuel Gorton, and others, in the purchase of a large tract on the western shore of Narragansett Bay from Miantonomi. Here was commenced the settlement of Shawomut, which afterward became k
  2 CONC nown as Warwick. Richard Waterman did not removed thither, however, but remained in Providence. He endured with the other purchasers of that property the losses and persecutions which fell upon the small colony through the unjust 
  2 CONC claims of Massachusetts to the district. In 1643 the Massachusetts authorities sent a squad of soldiers to arrest the leaders of the colony, and carried them prisoners to Boston, where many of them were imprisoned for several mont
  2 CONC hs. Richard Waterman suffered the confiscation of part of his estate by order of the court in October, 1643, and was bound over to appear at the May term following. His companions barely escaped the death sentence, while the sente
  2 CONC nce pronounced against Waterman at the General Court was as follows: 'Being found erroneous, heretical and obstinate, it was agreed that he should be detained prisoner till the Quarter Court in the seventh month, unless five of th
  2 CONC e magistrates do find cause to send him away; which, if they do, it is ordered that he shall not return within this jurisdiction upon pain of death.' After his release, however, he took an important part in securing justice for th
  2 CONC e Warwick settlers. The long controversy was eventually settled by a decision of the English authorities in favor of the rightful owners who had purchased the land from Miantonomi. Waterman held possession of his valuable property
  2 CONC  in Providence and in old Warwick, bequeathing it to his heirs, whose descendants have been numerous and prominent and influential in Rhode Island affairs to the present day.

 1 NOTE {geni:occupation} Deputy Governor Rhode Island
 1 NOTE {geni:about_me} The Cards had spent time in Block Island, which was then known as New Shoreham. Their fortunes seemed to be linked to the sea as well as farming. Cross referencing records some scholars believe they can relate the 
  2 CONC early Greenmans and Cards to some of the early ships of the Mass Bay Colony and to the communities of Watertown and Dorchester, Mass. USA. According to the Rhode Island Genealogical Register (Vol 3, No.3), the earliest Card in New
  2 CONC  Endland was Richard Card, who was born about 1620, possibly in  Devon or Dorset in the southwest of England, where the name is found. He was the first mentioned in Newport on August 29, 1653 when he was a juryman. In 1655 he beca
  2 CONC me a freeman of Newport. Richard was one of the original grantees of Coanicut Island (Jamestown) in 1656 and in June 1658 he served on a jury in Newport. Richard died before July1,1674 when Joesph Card was granted land next to tha
  2 CONC t of Job Card, then in the possession of his mother. Richard married Rebecca. His widow married again in before November 20,1692 to George Hassell of Newport and Westerly. Little more is known of Richard because of the partial des
  2 CONC truction of the early Newport records following the British occupation in the Revolutionary War. Richard and Rebecca possibly had daughters but their names are not known.

 1 NOTE BIOGRAPHY: "Phillips Bradford" <pvbrad@attbi.com> 
  2 CONT Dear Mr. Knight.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT I have just found an alternative idea about who Sarah Rogers' parents were (at least her father).
  2 CONT
  2 CONT The Mayflower passengers, Thomas Rogers, and his son Joseph Rogers, are discussed on the following "official" Mayflower web sites:
  2 CONT Thomas Rogers: See: http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/Passengers/ThomasRogers.php
  2 CONT Joseph Rogers: See: http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/Passengers/JosephRogers.php
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Now, on the Joseph Rogers site. It says he married "Hannah, probably around 1632 (if she is the mother of all his children.)", where no surname is provided for Hannah, and there is a caveat about whether or not said Hanna is the m
  2 CONC other of all his children. It also states that after Thomas Rogers died in 1621, Joseph was 18 years old and lived for 10 years in the household of Gov. William Bradford (my direct ancestor). There are many sources that will confi
  2 CONC rm that Gov. Bradford adopted many children whose parents died in the hardships of 1621.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT A little further down on the page for Joseph Rogers, there is a link to his will. This will shows no mention of a daughter named Sarah.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT However, here is the big clue: See the web page:

  2 CONC  we were constrained to dismiss him, and hire Mr. Rogers in his room, Mr. Pierce being willing to release him, to do us a favor. He is to have 35s per month, whereof he desires his wife may have 16s a month, which we pray you may

  2 CONT This says that Mr. Rogers (which could only be Joseph Rogers) was being released from his master (Rogers was probably an indentured servant under Mr. Pierce), to replace the "proud and quarrelsome surgeon in the pinnace". It also 
  2 CONC says that both he (Joseph Rogers) AND HIS WIFE were to be paid. This clearly shows that Joseph Rogers was married and lived in Plymouth in 1623. Could he not be the father of Sarah Rogers, who was born in Plymouth in 1625?  Could 
  2 CONC "Hannah" be his second wife, and since he left his house to Hannah, could the children of his first wife have been left out of his will. This could also explain why Sarah would have married Richard Knight, a man that was 21 years 
  2 CONC older than she, when she was 23 years old, and moved away to Newport RI.  The Colony of Rhode Island had been founded upon some different principles than Plymouth, and her move to RI would have been taken as an abandonment of Plym

  2 CONT
  2 CONT Immigration: By Aug 4, 1640. Probably arrived by himself, although we know he had a wife, with unknown name, who may have died before he migrated, and a son in England. Aged from 20-40 years old.

  2 CONT ================================
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Biographical Sketch: From NEHGR, Jul 1933, Pg 264-5, article by G. Andrew Moriarity, of Bristol, Rhode Island:
  2 CONT
  2 CONT "The founder of the family in New England was Richard Knight [** actually, not quite true, as there were other immigrant Knights in New England nmt**], who was at Newport as early as December, 1646. Austin knew nothing earlier tha
  2 CONC n this about him; but there are references to him in the Essex Quarterly Court files at Salem, Mass., that show that prior to his arrival in Rhode Island he had lived at Hampton, N. H., where he had a mill.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Richard Knight, of Hampton, N. H., and Newport, R. I., was living in 1680, but died before Oct 27 of that year. He married first, in England, _________; and secondly, about 1647, Sarah Rogers, daughter of James and Mary Rogers of 
  2 CONC Newport, R. I. who was living at East Greenwich Feb 23, 1684/5, when she served on a jury of women with respect to the condition of a young woman.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Richard Knight probably came to Hampton, N. H. from Co. Norfolk, England, as most of the earliest inhabitants of Hampton (N. H.) came from that part of England.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT On Aug 4, 1640, an agreement was made between the town of Hampton and Richard Knight regarding his building and keeping a mill at the landing there, and 100 acres were granted to him. On Sep 14, 1640 he contracted to build a meeti
  2 CONC ng house. On Jan 29, 1640/1, it was voted that instead of working on the Common Richard Knight was to make a gate for the pound. He was the defendant in a suit brought by Stephen Kent in December, 1641. On Jul 9, 1645, a warrant f
  2 CONC or his arrest was issued to the constables of Boston, Mass., on account of certain thieving activities of his, and on Sep 9, 1645, Joseph Armetage was ordered by the Court to hold all the goods in his hands of Richard Knight "late
  2 CONC  of Hampton, now of Rhode Island." (Essex Quarterly Court Files, Vol 1, Pg 88, and History of Hampton.)
  2 CONT
  2 CONT In Rhode Island he was a house carpenter by trade, and the items given above show that he practiced the same trade at Hampton. He probably fled to Rhode Island at some time between Jul 8 and Sep 9, 1645, to escape punishment for h
  2 CONC is misdeeds. This experience seems to have had a salutary effect on him, for thenceforth his life in Rhode Island was, so far as is known, entirely decorous.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Following are events in which he has been found recorded:
  2 CONT * Feb, 1646 (?1645/6) Goodman Knight conveyed his house, mill, and 100 acres at Hampton to Christopher Lawson of Boston, Mass.
  2 CONT * December, 1646, he brought suit at Newport against William Jeffrey (Acquidneck Quarterly Court Files, printed).
  2 CONT * Jan 16, 1647/8 land at Newport was conveyed to him by James Rogers, whose daughter Sarah he married about this time.
  2 CONT * Feb 8, 1648/9, he agreed with his wife Sarah not to sell the 40 acres of land bought of James Rogers and Robert Griffin, but entailed it upon her and eldest son by her, who was to have it at the age of twenty years. If he should
  2 CONC  have no son, then the land was to go over to their eldest daughter, at the age of sixteen years. Moreover, his son in Old England was to have no part in it. (Rhode Island Colonial Deeds, edited by Chapin, Vol 1, Pg 6).
  2 CONT * 1648/9 he kept the prison in Newport. He was a general sergeant in 1648, 1649, 1650, 1653, 1654, 1657, and 1658.
  2 CONT * 1655..  His name occurs on the roll of freemen at Newport.
  2 CONT * 1655..  He was sent to summon the Warwick sachem Pomham before the court on Mar 17, 1655/6.
  2 CONT * 1656..  He sold land at Newport on Dec 22, 1656 and Dec 5, 1658. In the latter year he was "Water Bailey".
  2 CONT * Jan 19, 1663/4, he made, in partnership with Henry Hall, the great purchase of lands at Chippachog, in Westerly and Kingston, from the Indians, which was afterwards known as the Hall and Knight Purchase.
  2 CONT * 1677..  He appears to have rendered service to the Colony in King Philip's War, for on Oct 31, 1677, he was one of the grantees of the East Greenwich lands, for service in that war. Each grantee received 100 acres
  2 CONT * Dec 11, 1679, he, together with his wife and eldest son, John, sold land.
  2 CONT * 1680..  He was alive as late as 1680, when he was taxed 7 s.
  2 CONT * By Oct 27, 1680, he was dead, as on that date his widow petitioned for a confirmation of the lands in Greenwich that he had settled upon her, and this was allowed."
  2 CONT
  2 CONT His children, thus forming the main branches of his descendancy, were: an unknown son in England, John, Jonathon, David, Richard, Priscilla, and Rebecca. To the best of my knowledge, the marriages and descendants of the girls are 
  2 CONC unknown.

  2 CONT
  2 CONT       The "proven" origins of Richard Knight of Rhode Island are unknown to me.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT       Early settlers of Hampton, New Hampshire were from Norfolk, England and that may be an indication of his origins. However, McCormick-Hamilton-Lord-Day Ancestral Lines, compiled for Elizabeth Day McCormick & Robert Hall McCor
  2 CONC mick III, privately printed, 1957, suggests Richard came from Kent Co., England. This is apparently based on the origins of other settlers of Greenwich, Rhode Island.

  2 CONT The Early Knights of Rhode Island
  2 CONT By G. Andrews Moriarty, A.M., LL.B., F.S.A., of Bristol, R.I.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT    The early history of the Knight Family, which became prominent in Providence in the last century, is somewhat obscure, and the account given in Austin's "Dictionary" is not entirely satifactory. Therefore it is the purpose of t
  2 CONC he contributor of this article to present a brief history of the early generations of the family.
  2 CONT    The founder of the family in New England was Richard Knight, who was at Newport as early as December 1646. Austin knew nothing earlier than this about him; but there are references to him in the Essex Quarterly Court files at S
  2 CONC alem, Mass., that show that prior to his arrival in Rhode Island he had lived at Hampton, N.H., where he had a mill.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT 1. Richard (1) Knight, of Hampton, N.H., and Newport, R.I., was living in 1680, but died before 27 Oct. of that year. He married first in England, ________; and secondly, about 1647, Sarah Rogers, daughter of James and Mary Rogers
  2 CONC  of Newport, R.I., who was living at East Greenwich 24 Feb. 1684/5, when she served on a jury of women with respect to the condition of a young women.
  2 CONT    Richard Knight probably came to Hampton, N.H. from co. Norfolk, England, as most of the earliest inhabitants of Hampton came from that part of England.
  2 CONT    On 4 Aug. 1640 and agreement was made between the town of Hampton and Richard Knight regarding his building and keeping a mill at the landing there, and 100 acres were granted to him. On 14 Sept. 1640 he contracted to build a m
  2 CONC eeting house. On 29 Jan. 1640/1 it was voted that instead of working on the Common Richard Knight was to make a gate for the pound. He was the defendant in a suit brought by Stephen Kent in December 1641. On 9 July 1645 a warrant 
  2 CONC for his arrest was issued to the constables of Boston, Mass., on account of certain thieving activities of his, and on 9 Sept. 1645 Joseph Armetage was ordered by the Court to hold all the goods in his hands of Richard Knight "lat
  2 CONC e of Hampton, now of Rhode Island." (Essex Quarterly Court Files, vol. 1, p. 88 and History of Hampton.) In Rhode Island he was a house carpenter by trade, and the the items given above show that he practiced the same trade at Ham
  2 CONC pton. He probably fled to Rhode Island at some time between 9 July and 9 Sept. 1645, to escape punishment for his misdeeds. This experience seems to have had a salutary effect on him, for thenceforth his life in Rhode Island was, 
  2 CONC so far as is known, entirely decorous. In February 1646 [? 1645/6] Goodman Knight conveyed his house, mill, and 100 acres at Hampton to Christopher Lawson of Boston, Mass. In December 1646 he brought suit at Newport against Willia
  2 CONC m Jeffery (Acquidneck Quarterly Court Files, printed). On 16 Jan. 1647/8 land at Newport was conveyed to him by James Rogers, whose daughter Sarah he married about this time. On 8 Feb. 1648/9 he agreed with his wife Sarah not to s
  2 CONC ell the 40 acres of land bought of James Rogers and Robert Griffin, but entailed it upon her and his eldest son by her, who was to have it at the age of twenty years. If he should have no son, then the land was to go to their elde
  2 CONC st daughter, at the age of sixteen years. Moreover, his son in Old England was to have no part in it. (Rhode Island Colonial  Deeds, edited by Chaplin, vol. 1, p. 6.) From 1648/9 he kept the prison in Newport. He was general serge
  2 CONC ant in 1648, 1649, 1650, 1653, 1654, 1657, and 1658. His name occurs on the roll of freeman at Newport in 1655. He was sent to summon the Warwick sachem Pomham before the Court on 17 Mar. 1655/6. He sold land at Newport on 22 Dec.
  2 CONC  1656 and 5 Dec. 1658. In the latter year he was "Water Bailey." On 19 Jan. 1663/4 he made, in partnership with Henry Hall, the great purchase of lands at Chippachog, in Westerly and Kingston, from the Indians, which was afterward
  2 CONC s known as the Hall and Knight purchase. He appears to have rendered service to the Colony in Philip's War, for on 31 Oct. 1677 he was one of the grantees of the East Greenwich lands, for service in that war. Each grantee received
  2 CONC  100 acres. On 11 Dec. 1679 he, together with his wife and his eldest son, John, sold land. He was alive as late as 1680, when he was taxed 7s., but by 27 Oct. 1680 he was dead, as on that date his widow petitioned for a confirmat
  2 CONC ion of the lands in  East Greenwich that he had settled upon her, and this was allowed.

  2 CONT THE STARBUCK LINE (found on Ancestry.com):  The name Starbuck is Scandinavian and signifies a person of imposing appearance, great or grand bearing.....bokki meaning "vis grandis corpore et animo. Ferguson gives it Starbocki, from
  2 CONC  Star, great "vir imperiosus." It is not improbable that the family was of Danish origin and settled in England in the days of what is historically known as the Danish Invasion. Patronymica Brittannica says in "O. Norse bokki; mea
  2 CONC ns "vir grandis, corpose et animo." Hence Starbocki from Stor, great.

  2 CONT Note: Edward migrated to America about 1635, settling at Dover. He was representative in the General Court in 1643 and 1646, was an Elder in the church and in other ways enjoyed the respect and esteem of his fellow citizens. His i
  2 CONC nfluence over the Indians was so great that if at any time a suspicion or alarm arose among the early settlers, he was always in requisition to explain the apparent cause thereof, and to suggest a palliation for their rude and ine
  2 CONC xplicable action, which served to allay the fears of the more timid. There is a tradition that at one time an uprising among the Indians seemed imminent. They appeared to be gathering in hostile groups and as they greatly outnumbe
  2 CONC red the whites, it was a very serious affair. In this juncture, Edward Starbuck went unhesitatingly among them and soon succeeded in quieting them. The deed of Coatue to him by the Sachems as a "free and voluntary" gift shows thei

  2 CONT Notes:
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Edward Starbuck and his wife Katherine came to New England about 1635, and settled in Dover, NH. Although there is no documented evidence to date, Edward's wife is traditionally known as Katherine Reynolds. As early as 1862, James
  2 CONC  Savage, in A Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England, wrote that Edward Starbuck "m. Eunice or Catherine Reynolds, said to be from Wales." Early Settlers of Nantucket, compiled by Lydia S. Hinchman and publis
  2 CONC hed is 1901, states that Edward's wife was "Katharine (Reynolds), of Wales." A footnote states "Some authorities give Eunice." George Edward McConnell and David Ross McConnell, in Our Family's Starbuck Ancestry, published 1963, st
  2 CONC ate "his wife, Katherine Reynolds, daughter of Robert, is thought to have been Welch." This Reynolds connection was also acknowledged in the Genealogical Dictionary of Maine and New Hampshire, by Sybil Noyes, Charles Thornton Libb
  2 CONC ey and Walter Goodwin Davis in 1939. They stated that "his wife Katherine is repeatedly called Katherine Reynolds, but no documented evidence of the 'Reynolds' has been seen." Such long-standing tradition should not be taken light
  2 CONC ly, despite the current lack of extant evidence, and until research proves otherwise, we will consider that Katherine and her descendants constitute a branch of the Reynolds family in America.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT As is generally the case in early colonial records, there is much documented about the life of Edward Starbuck, but little information about Katherine, his wife.  ...  Katherine Starbuck is known through her signing with her husba
  2 CONC nd on two deeds. She signed with him in May or July 1653 when they sold land to their son-in-law Peter Coffin. Later in 1659, Edward and Katherine deeded land to Mr. Broughton, which excepted the house and land on the Newichawanno
  2 CONC ck River which belonged to "Goodwife Starbuck" as "being formerly given her...in wife's right..."
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Edward died at Nantucket 4 Mar 1690, age 86. There is no record of Katherine's death. Some sources assume that she died in Dover prior to the move to Nantucket, however, Noyes, Libbey and Davis state that she was living 19 June 16
  2 CONC 78 (without citing a source for this date). It is probable that she had died by 1685 when Edward alone deeded to son Nathaniel.

 1 NOTE Individual:From the PIAF genealogy web-siteNear the village of Salisbury, in Wiltshire, Emgland, in the parish of Chilmark, resided, prior to his embarkation to America in ca. 1635, Thomas Macy. The name of the vessel upon 
  2 CONC which he sailed is not recorded.He is one of the original settlers of Salisbury, Massachusetts. He is listed there with a lot in 1639. He is listed as "a merchant, planter, one of the selectmen, a juryman &also a preacher." M
  2 CONC assachusetts laws passed in 1656 & 1657 restricted the freedom of worship. How ironic that these settlers who in large part fled England to freely worship as they wished would so rapidly impose the same types of restrictions in
  2 CONC  their new land!Thomas Macy was prosecuted for violating these laws which prohibited "entertaining Quakers". He was fined 30 shillings & admonished by the governor. He sheltered Edward Wharton, William Robinson & Marmaduke St
  2 CONC ephenson during a rainstorm. The last two were hanged on Boston Common on October 27th, 1659 because they were Quakers.The hostility around these events led him to join with others to move to territory not so dominated by Puri
  2 CONC tans which brought him to the island of "Martin's Vineyard".________________________________________________________GREAT-GRANDFATHERS COFFIN, MACY, SWAYNE & FOLGER ACQUIRE NANTUCKET During the summer of 1659, Tristram Coffin,
  2 CONC  given the religious & political climate, decided to move & decided to visit the islands lying off the south-east coast of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. So, accompanied by Edward Starbuck & Isaac Coleman (the latter a mere yout
  2 CONC h of 13 years of age), he visited Martha's Vineyard. He learned there that the title to Nantucket was held by Great Grandfather Thomas Mayhew, & that Mayhew was willing to dispose of most of his interest there. Great Grandfathe
  2 CONC r Coffin decided to sail to that island to make a survey of it, & evaluate its adaptability to their purpose. They decided to take with them from the Vineyard Great Grandfather Peter Folger to act as an interpreter since he sp
  2 CONC oke Wampanoag & the others didn't. Great-grandfather Coffin hoped to find a place where his children could be located around him. He also wanted to find out if the Indians as well were willing to sell their lands & on what t
  2 CONC erms, etc. Mr. Coffin, finding the Island suited to his plans, & the sachems willing to make satisfactory terms, reported back to his friends. As a result, they signed the following agreement, as copied from the Town Records:
  2 CONC "These people after mentioned did buy all right & Interest of the Island of Nantucket that Did belong to Sir Ferdinand George & Mr. James Forret Steward to Lord Sterling, which was by them sold unto Mr. Thomas Mayhew of Martha'
  2 CONC s Vineyard these after- mentioned Did purchase of Mr. Thomas Mayhew these Rights; namely the pattent Right belonging to the Gentlemen aforesaid & also the piece of Land which Mr. Mayhew did purchase of the Indians at the west 
  2 CONC End of the Island of Nantucket as by their grant or bill of Sale will largely appear with all the privileges & appurtenances there- of--the aforementioned Purchasers are Tristram Coffin Senior. Thomas Macy, Richard Swain, Thoma
  2 CONC s Barnard, Peter Coffin, Chris- topher Hussey, Stephen Greenleaf, John Swain, William Pile, the said Mr. Thomas Mayhew himself also become a Twentyeth part pur- chaser so that they Vizt. Mr. Thomas Mayhew, Tristram Coffin Snr.
  2 CONC ., Thomas Macy, Richard Swain, Thomas Barnard, Peter Coffin, Christopher Hussey, Stephen Greenleaf, John Swain, William Pike, had the whole & Sole Interest Disposal power, & privilege of said Island & appurtenances thereof." O
  2 CONC f the same date as the Agreement is the following Deed from Mr. Mayhew to the ten proprietors."Be it known unto all men by these Presents that I Thomas Mayhew of Martin's vineyard, Merchant do hereby acknowledge that I have
  2 CONC  sold unto Tristram Coffin, Thomas Macy, Christopher Hussey, Richard Swain, Thomas Barnard, Peter Coffin, Stephen Greenleaf, John Swain & William Pike all that Right & Interest that I have in the Island of Nantucket by pattent

  2 CONC ord so much as is legible but Time has Defaced some part thereof.") Shortly after signing these deeds, the ten original settlers, of whom four were your great-grandparents, they decided to take partners. The Coffins by thems
  2 CONC elves also acquired the island of Tuckernuck.In February 1659 at Salisbury, "At a Meeting of the purchasers, or the major part of them, approved of & allowed by the rest, together with some others that was owned for Associat
  2 CONC es, as will hereafter appear; it was agreed & Determined & approved as follows, vizt that the ten owners will admit of Ten more partners who shall have Liberty to take a partner whom he pleases not being justly Excepted against
  2 CONC  by the rest. At that Meeting Robert Pike was owned partner with Christopher Hussey, Robert Barnard was owned partner with Thomas Barnard, Edwd Starbuck was owned to be Thomas Macys partner & Tristram Coffin Jnr partner with St
  2 CONC ephen Greenleaf, James Coffin with Peter Coffin. At the same Meeting it was mutually & Unanimously agreed upon determined & Concluded that no man whatsoever shall purchase any Land of any of the Indians upon the said Land for h
  2 CONC is own private particular use, but whatsoever purchase shall be made shall be for the general account of the Twenty owners or purchasers & whatsoever person shall purchase any Land upon any other account it shall be utterly vo
  2 CONC id & null except what is don by Leve from the said owners or purchasers. at the same Meeting it was ordered & Determined that there shall be ten other Inhabitant admitted into the Plantation who shall have such Accommodation as
  2 CONC  the owners or purchasers shall judge meet--as namely necessary tradesmen, & seamen.Besides those named in the above record John Smith was chosenpartner with Thomas Mayhew; Nathaniel Starbuck with TristramCoffin Sr.; Thomas L
  2 CONC ook with Richard Swain; Thomas Coleman withJohn Swain; & Thomas Mayhew Jr. with his father Thomas Mayhew Senior.Peter Folger is appointed Surveyor of the IslandAt another meeting of the proprietors held in Salisbury, thedec
  2 CONC ision of the previous meeting in regard to the purchase ofland was read, confirmed & ordered to stand "Inviolable unalterable,"'as that which is likely necessary to the Continuance of the wellbeing of the place & the Contrary t
  2 CONC hat which tends to the Con-fusion & Ruine of the whole & the Subverting of the rules& orders already agreed upon & the depriving of the said ownersof their just rights & Interests." At the same meeting it wasordered that all t
  2 CONC he arable land convenient for house lots shouldbe measured that it might "be divided by equal proportions, thatis to say Four Fifths parts to the owners or purchasers and theother Fifth unto the Ten other Inhabitants, whereof J
  2 CONC ohn Bishop shall have two parts or Shares, that is to say of that Fifth partbelonging to the Ten Inhabitant. Also at the same meeting itwas ordered that Tristram Coffin, Thomas Macy, Edward Starbuck.Thomas Barnard, Peter Folge
  2 CONC r of Martha's Vineyard, shall havepower to Measure and lay out said Land according to the abovesaid order and whatsoever shall be done and concluded in thesaid case by or any three of them, Peter Folger being one, shallbe acco
  2 CONC unted Legall and valid."Acquisition from the Indigenous InhabitantsAs Alexander Starbuck reports, having acquired by purchase the English right to Nantucket, it was not only in accordance with many precedents in the Massach
  2 CONC usetts Bay that the proprietors should reimburse the Indians for their rights, but also in accordance with their sense of honor and justice. Wanackmamack and Nickanoose being the principal Sachems it was necessary to treat with
  2 CONC  them. In fact, as Macy says, the men belonging or intending to belong to the association were not disposed to engage in the enterprise until an agreement was made with the Indians, consequently just after a verbal arrangement 
  2 CONC was made with the Sachems, several families moved to the Island.In May 1660, however, a formal deed was given reading as follows:"These presents witness, May the tenth sixteen hundred and sixty, that we Wanackmamack and Nick
  2 CONC anoose, head Sachems or` Nantucket island, do give, grant, bargain and sell, unto Mr. Thomas Mayhew of Martin's Vineyard, Tristram Co in, senior, Thomas Macy, Christopher Hussey, Richard Swain, Peter Coff in, Stephen Greenleaf
  2 CONC , Thomas Barnard, John Swain, and William Pile, all the Land, Meadow, Marshes, Timber and Wood, and all appurtenances thereunto belonging, and being and lying from the west end of the island of Nantucket, unto the Pond, called 
  2 CONC by the Indians, Waqutuquab, and from the head of that Pond, upon a straight line, unto the Pond situated by Monomoy Harbor or Creek, now called Wheeler's Creek, and so from the northeast corner of the said Pond to the Sea, tha

  2 CONC her Macy It is a crisp October morning in 1653 as a small open boat, filled to the gunwales with people & provisions, sails down the Merrimack River. Most of the boat's passengers belong to the Thomas Macy family from Salisbur
  2 CONC y on the north side of the river, a place so dedicated to lumber that barrel staves are accepted for taxes. As the river approaches the ocean, the heavily wooded riverbank to the south gives way to a sandy, shell-scattered sho
  2 CONC re beyond which stretches a wide tidal marsh. This, Thomas Macy tells his wife & children, is what their new home--an island known as Nantucket--will look like. To Sarah Macy & her five children, it might as well be the surf
  2 CONC ace of the moon. Leaving the river behind, they head down the coast, never losing sight of land as they sail past Cape Anne, Boston Harbor, & Plymouth, then veer east along the northern shore of Cape Cod. At some point along 
  2 CONC the way, they probably pull into a small cove for the night. Throughout the voyage, bluefish & striped bass are theirs for the taking--abounding in numbers that would astound someone from the twentieth century. Thousands of r
  2 CONC ight & Atlantic gray whales are just beginning to arrive from the north, & it would not be surprising if at some point the Macys find themselves surrounded by a pod of these curious & companionable leviathans. Not long after
  2 CONC  passing Barnstable Harbor on the north side of Cape Cod, the Macys begin to look for Boatmeadow Creek in the vicinity of Eastham. This narrow, naturally occurring passageway across the Cape (closed by a storm in 1770) enable
  2 CONC s them to avoid the potentially dangerous waters off Provincetown. Once on the south side of the Cape, they do not immediately head for Nantucket; instead they sail for Great Harbor (now Edgartown) on Martha's Vineyard, where 
  2 CONC they are greeted by Macy's cousin, Governor Thomas Mayhew. Although he is related by blood to the Puritan magistrate, Macy's Baptist religious beliefs have added an inevitable element of tension between the two men, especiall
  2 CONC y since it is a matter of religion that has prompted Macy's hurried sail for Nantucket. The previous summer, during a brief shower of rain, Macy made the mistake of giving shelter to four Quakers on their way to the nearby t
  2 CONC own of Hampton. The Puritan authorities were not pleased & demanded that he answer to the charge. In a letter of explanation Macy claimed to "have been for some weeks past very ill" & could therefore not appear before the Gene
  2 CONC ral Court. It was not long, however, before Macy & his family were sailing down the New England coast. Now, after resting themselves & gathering a final store of provisions, they have only a few more miles to go before they 
  2 CONC are home free. To this day, the passage from Martha's Vineyard to Nantucket is no easy matter; the shoals that line the waters between the two islands are notoriously dangerous. So Macy seeks the assistance of a Vineyarder by
  2 CONC  the name of Daggett, who agrees to serve as pilot for the last leg of the journey to Nantucket. His family has recently gotten into trouble with Governor Mayhew for purchasing a tract of land directly from the Indians, & Dagg
  2 CONC ett is looking forward to spending the entire winter on Nantucket, far away from the turmoil on the Vineyard. Unfortunately, the fall is nor the safest time for sea travel in New England. The months of October & November a
  2 CONC re known for sudden & dangerous storms. And, true to form, almost as soon as Macy's little boat leaves Great Harbor, the weather takes a turn for the worse. Storm clouds appear on the horizon as the wind & waves begin to buil
  2 CONC d. Soon all on board are soaked & miserable, with several miles still left to go against a stiff easterly head wind. Above the cries of her children, Sarah Macy suggests that tomorrow might be a better day to sail for Nantuc
  2 CONC ket. Her husband, however, tells Daggett to continue on. As the weather worsens, it all becomes a little more than Sarah Macy can stand. In no uncertain terms she suggests that there is something downright diabolical about t
  2 CONC he storm; the work of witchcraft perhaps! Thomas Macy will have none of it. In words destined to become a Nantucket legend, he shouts: "Woman, go below & seek thy God. I fear not the witches on earth nor the devils in hell. 
  2 CONC Thus, in the storm that the Indian Roqua had predicted would bring the white man to Nantucket, Thomas Macy sails into Madaket Harbor. He was fifty-one years old, a self-described "merchant & clothier" & had been living in New
  2 CONC  England for close to a quarter of a century. Only a few years earlier, he had become part owner of a sawmill in the "new" section of Salisbury on the other side of the Powow River. And as his reputed words to his wife sugge
  2 CONC st, there was also a bit of the orator in Thomas Macy, who is elsewhere described as both a planter & "withal a preacher." In the fall of 1659, he & Sarah had five children--Sarah, thirteen; Great Grandmother Mary, eleven; Be
  2 CONC thia, nine; Thomas, six; & John, four. Uprooting a brood of this size from a town that he had helped carve out of the wilderness was not something to be entered into lightly. But life in Salisbury was not what it had once been.
  2 CONC  The town had been polarized by a squabble over the payment of a minister; those in the new section of town (now Amesbury) resented the fact that they were still supporting a minister in the old section of town. The combination
  2 CONC  of these local tensions with the General Court's new repressive measures against religious dissent had turned neighbor against neighbor; it had been a fellow townsman, after all, who had told the Puritan authorities about Mac
  2 CONC y's kindness to the Quakers. Given this atmosphere of treachery & deceit, an island thirty miles out to sea must have seemed like a beckoning refuge. Macy, however, was careful not to burn any bridges by his sudden removal to
  2 CONC  Nantucket. The fine levied against him by the General Court was promptly paid, &, contrary to a myth popular among Nantucketers, his property in Salisbury was never confiscated. In fact, in 1664 Macy would return there for t
  2 CONC he apparent purpose of selling his home & land. The town record for that year states: "Thomas Macy sold unto Anthony Colby, the house in which he, Thomas Macy, dwelleth at present... ." Although we do not know the exact date o
  2 CONC n which Macy left for Nantucket, there is indirect evidence that it was in late October. His letter to the General Court is dated October 27, 1653. As town clerk, Macy (who was by one account a "good penman kept the Salisbury 
  2 CONC town records, & on the first of November, 1659, the record book shifts to a different, less careful hand. Also of interest is the fact that Great Grandfather Peter Folger, a Vineyarder who would ultimately move to Nantucket in
  2 CONC  1663, chose to state publicly his Baptist beliefs at a Great Harbor town meeting that October. Was Folger's "Laying Down of his Creed" connected in any way with Macy's sail for Nantucket! Accompanying Macy on this historic voy
  2 CONC age was Edward Starbuck, a fifty-five-year-old lumber trader from Dover who had been fined for professing his Baptist beliefs more than ten years earlier. In any event, Macy's decision to relocate was not altogether spontaneou
  2 CONC s. For the previous year or so, he & several friends & neighbors in the Merrimack River Valley had been examining the possibility of purchasing Nantucket Island, with the expectation of beginning a new community outside the 
  2 CONC realm of Puritan control. In June of that year, Macy, as well as 9th Great Grandfather Tristram Coffin & John Coleman had all traveled to the island where they witnessed the sale of the "plain at the West end of Nantucket" to 
  2 CONC Great Grandfather Thomas Mayhew by the Indian sachems Nickanoose & Nanahuma. Then on July 2nd, Macy & Coffin negotiated the purchase of the island from Mayhew for the sum of thirty pounds & two beaver hats. Until Macy's hospita
  2 CONC lity toward the quakers prompted him to pack up & leave Salisbury that fall, the original & more sensible plan appears to have been to begin settlement during the following spring. While it was religious belief that may have
  2 CONC  spurred Macy & Starbuck to sail for Nantucket, there were two other crew members who came to Nantucket for different reasons. The nineteen-year-old 8th Great GrandfatherJames Coffin (son of Tristram Coffin) probably went along
  2 CONC  to protect his father's business investment.. With control over nor only his own share in the island, but also those of his three sons & a son-in-law, 'Tristram Coffin had more reason than most to be concerned that nothing ha
  2 CONC ppened to endanger the future of the settlement during first winter. And clearly Macy & Starbuck (no longer young men, particularly by seventeen century standards) could use all the help they could get. In fact, also along fo
  2 CONC r this historic ride was a twelve-year-old boy by the name of Isaac Coleman. But if this assortment of four men, one woman, & six children might seem like an unlikely group of pioneers, Nantucket in 1659 was not exactly a ho
  2 CONC wling wilderness. For many years now, Mayhew & others had been visiting the island on a regular basis for the purpose of converting the Indians to Christianity. The Vineyarders had also been grazing their sheep & cattle on th
  2 CONC e western endof the island, & Macy): & company undoubtedly sailed for some kind of rude dock or existing boat landing upon their arrival at Madaket. According to Obed Macy, Nantucket's first English resident ultimately "chos
  2 CONC e a spot for settlement on the southeast side of Madaket harbor, where he found a rich soil & an excellent spring of water--not far from what is now known as Warren's Landing. According to another account, Starbuck chose to l
  2 CONC ive "near two miles apart" from the Macy family, a tradition that is born out by the town records from 1670 in which there is mention of "the meadows lying between Long Pond by the old cellar built by Edward Starbuck." Thee c
  2 CONC olonial architecture expert Henry Chandlee Forman hypothesizes that along with wigwams, Nantucket's Indians also built "dugouts" to escape the winter winds, describing them as "crude abodes half inside the ground," the rough 
  2 CONC equivalent of what the English would call a cellar. (;given the time of year of their arrival, a dugout based on the Indian model certainly seems like a quick and sensible housing option, the remains of which apparently provi
  2 CONC ded a lasting memorial to that first winter. By all accounts the Indians greeted Macy & Starbuck "with kindness and hospitality" otherwise it is difficult to believe that the two men would have chosen to live so far apart. A
  2 CONC t one point, however, Macy seems to have gotten quite a scare. According to one tradition, a large number of Indians assembled near Macy's dwelling and "worked themselves up into a great fury, singing and dancing with all th
  2 CONC eir might." Fearful that this was the prelude to an attack, Macy sent "a boy" (probably Isaac Coleman) to Starbuck's house. "Being a bold man," Starbuck immediately put on his hat, picked up his cane, and charged over to Mac
  2 CONC y's. After studying the Indians for a few minutes, Starbuck is reputed to have shouted, "is not the Lord on our side! Of whom shall we he afraid One shall chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight!" Then, brandishin
  2 CONC g his cane as if it were a sword, he "sallied forth upon the astonished natives," who quickly dispersed. later, once they had become better acquainted with local Indian customs, Starbuck and Macy realized that the gathering h
  2 CONC ad been nothing more than a "grand Pow-wow." Starbuck (which in Norse means "great or "grand" was apparently a man of considerable force and determination, and the Indians--despite his histrionics with the cane--seem to have 
  2 CONC been especially fond of him. He was one of the few settlers who took the time to learn Algonquian, and on the fifth of January, 1660, Sachem Nickanoose was moved to deed to Starbuck all of Coatue 'out of my free voluntary lo
  2 CONC ve." Dagget the Vineyarder, also deeply impressed the Indians, but in a different way. Daggett apparently spent most of that first winter "gunning" for birds. According to one source, the native Nantucketers "were astonished
  2 CONC  at the effect of the firearms, by which more birds could be killed in a day, than they could destroy with their arrows in a month." In all probability, Sarah Macy served a lot of duck during that first winter on the island.
  2 CONC  Thus was established the foothold that would open the way for the arrival of ten more families that summer. Edward Starbuck would be joined by his children (there is no evidence, however, that his wife Katherine ever emigra
  2 CONC ted to Nantucket). Although Daggett would eventually settle on the island in the following century, this first Daggett would return to the Vineyard. James Coffin would return to the Merrimack Valley area, get married, and then 
  2 CONC eventually return to become Nantucket's first Judge of Probate. The Macys would become an important part of the community that soon sprang up around them, although Thomas, Jr., would die tragically in 1675 at the age of twenty
  2 CONC -two, leaving only John (who would die at thirty-six) to carry on the Macy name. And what about Isaac Coleman, the twelve-year-old boy! Isaac is something of a mystery. According to popular tradition, he was an orphan, but t
  2 CONC he record shows that he was the son of Thomas Coleman who ultimately moved from Hampton to Nantucket with several of Isaac's siblings. Why Isaac accompanied the Macys to Nantucket in 1659 is unknown. Perhaps he was apprenticed
  2 CONC  to Macy, who was a skilled weaver. In any event, if the anecdote about the Indian pow-wow is any indication, the boy seems to have been a genuine help to his caretakers during that first winter. When only nineteen Coleman wa
  2 CONC s appointed to a committee to collect fines from Indian and English Nantucketers who refused to kill their dogs, demonstrating that he was already a respected member of the community. Except for this one reference, he disappear
  2 CONC s from the record until two years later in June of 1669 , when we know that he sailed to the Vineyard in a canoe. Accompanying him were four others---Great Grandfather Eleazar Folger and his sister Bethiah with her new husband
  2 CONC  John Barnard, plus an Indian. In Great Harbor they purchased, among other things, an iron plowshare, and soon they were on their way back to Nantucket, a southwesterly sea breeze undoubtedly hurrying them on their way. Altho
  2 CONC ugh it was under very different circumstances, the sail back to Nantucket must have reminded Isaac of that first voyage so long ago, particularly as the sea breeze built to the point of becoming dangerous. But instead of Mr. a
  2 CONC nd Mrs. Macys' tense exchanges, these young people showed little concern; sailing between the two islands had become old hat. Then the fate that the Macys had been lucky enough to avoid suddenly struck: the boat capsized. A
  2 CONC lthough they tried to cling to the canoe, it was not long before Isaac and the Barnards, as well as the Indian, were dragged under by their heavy clothes and drowned. Just as Eleazer was about to go down for the last time, h
  2 CONC is feet struck the sand of a shoal. It took all his strength, but he was able to right the canoe and pull himself into it. A swamped canoe, however, is more than likely to capsize once again, so it was imperative that Eleazer 
  2 CONC bail it out as quickly as possible--but with what. Lashed inside the canoe was the plowshare, and so with its heavy iron scoop he gradually emptied the boar of water. Exhausted, and without oars or a sail with which to guide 
  2 CONC the canoe, he put down the plowshare and collapsed. Ultimately he would drift all the way to Cape Cod, where two Indians fishing off Morris Island near Chatham were surprised to find a man lying inside what they had assumed w
  2 CONC as an empty canoe. In the next several days, the English community on Nantucket went into mourning when it was realized that the canoe was never coming back. And then, after all had been been given up for lost, Eleazer arrived
  2 CONC  on a sloop from Cape Cod and told his terrible story. Although not related by blood - Edward Starbuck, James Coffin, and particularly the Macy family must have felt a special bond to their former shipmate, Isaac Coleman. On 
  2 CONC a cold fall day almost a decade before, it could have just as easily happened to all of them. This date cant be right- there grandson is born in 1673-4!!!Found a web page with marriage date of 9/6/1639 - much more likely

  2 CONT Biography
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Thomas emigrated from England to Salisbury MA in 1640. He was 'considerably' older than his brother Robert. He is mentioned in the records as planter and husbandman. He received lands in the first division of Salisbury in 1640-43 
  2 CONC and also was one of the first 18 settlers in Amesbury, where he received lands at various times, besides a 'township' for one of his sons in 1660.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT His house lot is shown on the map of Salisbury in 1639. He was one of the signers of the 'articles of agreement' and one of the first eighteen commoners of Salisbury. On 1 Jan 1658, he and another were chosen to order the prudenti
  2 CONC al affairs of the county, and in the latter part of the same month was one of two persons chosen 'standing lot layers' and as such he served for many years. He was one of the ten original purchasers of Nantucket.
  2 CONT
  2 CONT Thomas was a very prominent man, and often served as moderator of the town meetings, as selectman, and in several other important offices. He was killed by indians in 1677 during King Philip's War.

  2 CONT Thomas Barnard
  2 CONT Thomas was the elder of the two brothers. He was born about 1608-1610 in Lowesoft, Suffolk, England. Some sources hint he was from Brandstone Parish in either Suffolk or Essex. However, researchers have not been able to find any p
  2 CONC roof in the registers of either parish. We may assume he and his brother were English, but as of now I do not know exactly where they lived. Again many sources state the brothers came to America in 1650. Yet Thomas is shown on an 
  2 CONC old map as being a landholder in Salisbury, Massachusetts in 1639. Later the family also bought land a few miles away in neighboring Amesbury, Massachusetts. Thomas Barnard married a woman named Eleanor or Helen sometime about 164
  2 CONC 0 in Salisbury. Their first child, Thomas junior, was born there in May of 1641. Their second son, Nathaniel, was born there in 1642. Nathaniel married his cousin, Mary Barnard, and this is our lineage. Thomas seems to have had la
  2 CONC nds in both Salisbury and Amesbury. The children were all born in Salisbury, but he appears in early Amesbury records by 1660 and then in the records of both towns. Perhaps all the lands lay on the border and spilled over into bot
  2 CONC h towns. Thomas was one of the original purchasers of Nantucket Island in 1659. He gave a half interest to his brother Robert. It does not appear that he ever went to the island, but Robert did in 1663. Thomas was killed by Indian
  2 CONC s in Amesbury in October of 1677. His estate was settled in 1679. Eleanor Barnard remained in the area and on July 19, 1681 she married George Little of Newbury. She died on November 27, 1694. The following is what I have on the c
  2 CONC hildren of Thomas and Eleanor Barnard. All the children were born in Salisbury, Massachusetts. THOMAS BARNARD, JR. was born May 10, 1641 and died before 1715. He married Sarah Peasley in 1662. NATHANIEL BARNARD was born November 1

  2 CONT Thomas Barnard married a woman named Eleanor or Helen sometime about 1640 in Salisbury. Their first child, Thomas junior, was born there in May of 1641. Their second son, Nathaniel, was born there in 1642. Nathaniel married his co
  2 CONC usin, Mary Barnard, and this is our lineage. Thomas seems to have had lands in both Salisbury and Amesbury. The children were all born in Salisbury, but he appears in early Amesbury records by 1660 and then in the records of both 
  2 CONC towns. Perhaps all the lands lay on the border and spilled over into both towns. Thomas was one of the original purchasers of Nantucket Island in 1659. He gave a half interest to his brother Robert. It does not appear that he ever
  2 CONC  went to the island, but Robert did in 1663. Thomas was killed by Indians in Amesbury in October of 1677. His estate was settled in 1679. Eleanor Barnard remained in the area and on July 19, 1681 she married George Little of Newbu
